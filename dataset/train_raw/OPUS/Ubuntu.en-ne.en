Packages with unsatisfied dependencies The dependency requirements of these packages will be unmet after the install is complete. . The presence of this tree probably indicates that something is broken, either on your system or in the Debian archive.
Packages being removed because they are no longer used These packages are being deleted because they were automatically installed to fulfill dependencies, and the planned action will result in no installed package declaring an 'important' dependency on them.
Packages being automatically held in their current state These packages could be upgraded, but they have been kept in their current state to avoid breaking dependencies.
Packages being automatically installed to satisfy dependencies These packages are being installed because they are required by another package you have chosen for installation.
Packages being deleted due to unsatisfied dependencies These packages are being deleted because one or more of their dependencies is no longer available, or because another package conflicts with them.
Packages to be downgraded An older version of these packages than is currently installed will be installed.
Packages being held back These packages could be upgraded, but you have asked for them to be held at their current version.
Packages to be reinstalled These packages will be reinstalled.
Packages to be installed These packages have been manually selected for installation on your computer.
Packages to be removed These packages have been manually selected for removal.
Packages to be upgraded These packages will be upgraded to a newer version.
Packages that are partially installed These packages are not fully installed and configured; an attempt will be made to complete their installation.

Usage: apt-ftparchive [options] command Commands: packages binarypath [overridefile [pathprefix]] sources srcpath [overridefile [pathprefix]] contents path release path generate config [groups] clean config apt-ftparchive generates index files for Debian archives. It supports many styles of generation from fully automated to functional replacements for dpkg-scanpackages and dpkg-scansources apt-ftparchive generates Package files from a tree of .debs. The Package file contains the contents of all the control fields from each package as well as the MD5 hash and filesize. An override file is supported to force the value of Priority and Section. Similarly apt-ftparchive generates Sources files from a tree of .dscs. The --source-override option can be used to specify a src override file The 'packages' and 'sources' command should be run in the root of the tree. BinaryPath should point to the base of the recursive search and override file should contain the override flags. Pathprefix is appended to the filename fields if present. Example usage from the Debian archive: apt-ftparchive packages dists/potato/main/binary-i386/ > \\ dists/potato/main/binary-i386/Packages Options: -h This help text --md5 Control MD5 generation -s=? Source override file -q Quiet -d=? Select the optional caching database --no-delink Enable delinking debug mode --contents Control contents file generation -c=? Read this configuration file -o=?

TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.
Dialog frontend is incompatible with emacs shell buffers
Dialog frontend will not work on a dumb terminal, an emacs shell buffer, or without a controlling terminal.
No usable dialog-like program is installed, so the dialog based frontend cannot be used.
Dialog frontend requires a screen at least 13 lines tall and 31 columns wide.
Package configuration
You are using the editor-based debconf frontend to configure your system. See the end of this document for detailed instructions.
The editor-based debconf frontend presents you with one or more text files to edit. This is one such text file. If you are familiar with standard unix configuration files, this file will look familiar to you -- it contains comments interspersed with configuration items. Edit the file, changing any items as necessary, and then save it and exit. At that point, debconf will read the edited file, and use the values you entered to configure the system.
Debconf on %s
This frontend requires a controlling tty.
Term::ReadLine::GNU is incompatable with emacs shell buffers.

The following packages are in a mess due to serious problems during installation. They must be reinstalled for them (and any packages that depend on them) to function properly:
The following packages have been unpacked but not yet configured. They must be configured using dpkg --configure or the configure menu option in dselect for them to work:
The following packages are only half configured, probably due to problems configuring them the first time. The configuration should be retried using dpkg --configure <package> or the configure menu option in dselect:
The following packages are only half installed, due to problems during installation. The installation can probably be completed by retrying it; the packages can be removed using dselect or dpkg --remove:
Another process has locked the database for writing, and might currently be modifying it, some of the following problems might just be due to that.

Use dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files, and dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list their contents.
Format syntax: A format is a string that will be output for each package. The format can include the standard escape sequences \ (newline), \\r (carriage return) or \\\\ (plain backslash). Package information can be included by inserting variable references to package fields using the ${var[;width]} syntax. Fields will be right-aligned unless the width is negative in which case left alignment will be used.

Transparency indicator
Scroll wheel zoom
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Loop through the image sequence
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.

Invalid authentication
This server does not support this type of authentication and may not support authentication at all.
Check to make sure your password is spelled correctly. Remember that many passwords are case sensitive; your caps lock might be on.
Are you sure you want to send a message in HTML format?
Are you sure you want to send a message without a subject?
Adding a meaningful Subject line to your messages will give your recipients an idea of what your mail is about.
Are you sure you want to send a message with only BCC recipients?
The contact list you are sending to is configured to hide list recipients. Many email systems add an Apparently-To header to messages that only have BCC recipients. This header, if added, will list all of your recipients in your message. To avoid this, you should add at least one To: or CC: recipient.
Many email systems add an Apparently-To header to messages that only have BCC recipients. This header, if added, will list all of your recipients to your message anyway. To avoid this, you should add at least one To: or CC: recipient.

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version %s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla.gnome.org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

The '/' name can only be a directory, not a key
Value for `%s' set in a read-only source at the front of your configuration path
Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

Could not open '%s' for writing: %s
Error writing '%s': %s
Error reading '%s': %s
There was an error parsing your '%s' file. Default values will be used. A backup of your configuration has been created at '%s'.
When enabled, an image will become the active image when its image window receives the focus. This is useful for window managers using "click to focus".
Sets the canvas padding color used if the padding mode is set to custom color.
Specifies how the area around the image should be drawn.
How to handle embedded color profiles when opening a file.
Ask for confirmation before closing an image without saving.
Sets the pixel format to use for mouse pointers.
Sets the type of mouse pointers to use.
Context-dependent mouse pointers are helpful. They are enabled by default. However, they require overhead that you may want to do without.
When enabled, this will ensure that each pixel of an image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen.
This is the distance in pixels where Guide and Grid snapping activates.
Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a seed-fill algorithm. The seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold. This value represents the default threshold.
When enabled, the selected brush will be used for all tools.
When enabled, the selected gradient will be used for all tools.
When enabled, the selected pattern will be used for all tools.
Sets the browser used by the help system.
Sets the text to appear in image window status bars.
Sets the text to appear in image window titles.
When enabled, this will ensure that the full image is visible after a file is opened, otherwise it will be displayed with a scale of 1:1.
Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations.
How many recently opened image filenames to keep on the File menu.
Speed of marching ants in the selection outline. This value is in milliseconds (less time indicates faster marching).
GIMP will warn the user if an attempt is made to create an image that would take more memory than the size specified here.
Sets the monitor's horizontal resolution, in dots per inch. If set to 0, forces the X server to be queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution information.
Sets the monitor's vertical resolution, in dots per inch. If set to 0, forces the X server to be queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution information.
If enabled, the move tool sets the edited layer or path as active. This used to be the default behaviour in older versions.
Sets the size of the navigation preview available in the lower right corner of the image window.
Sets how many processors GIMP should try to use simultaneously.
Sets whether GIMP should create previews of layers and channels. Previews in the layers and channels dialog are nice to have but they can slow things down when working with large images.
Sets the preview size used for layers and channel previews in newly created dialogs.
When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself whenever the physical image size changes.
When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself when zooming into and out of images.
Let GIMP try to restore your last saved session on each startup.
Remember the current tool, pattern, color, and brush across GIMP sessions.
Save the positions and sizes of the main dialogs when GIMP exits.
Save the tool options when GIMP exits.
When enabled, all paint tools will show a preview of the current brush's outline.
When enabled, dialogs will show a help button that gives access to the related help page. Without this button, the help page can still be reached by pressing F1.
When enabled, the mouse pointer will be shown over the image while using a paint tool.
When enabled, the menubar is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Menubar" command.
When enabled, the rulers are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Rulers" command.
When enabled, the scrollbars are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Scrollbars" command.
When enabled, the statusbar is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Statusbar" command.
When enabled, the selection is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Selection" command.
When enabled, the layer boundary is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Layer Boundary" command.
When enabled, the guides are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Guides" command.
When enabled, the grid is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Grid" command.
When enabled, the sample points are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Sample Points" command.
Show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over an item.
What to do when the space bar is pressed in the image window.
Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".
When enabled, menus can be torn off.
When enabled, you can change keyboard shortcuts for menu items by hitting a key combination while the menu item is highlighted.
Save changed keyboard shortcuts when GIMP exits.
Restore saved keyboard shortcuts on each GIMP startup.
Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the course of running GIMP. Most files will disappear when GIMP exits, but some files are likely to remain, so it is best if this folder not be one that is shared by other users.
Sets the size of the thumbnail shown in the Open dialog.
The thumbnail in the Open dialog will be automatically updated if the file being previewed is smaller than the size set here.
When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap tiles to disk. This is a lot slower but it makes it possible to work on images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise. If you have a lot of RAM, you may want to set this to a higher value.
Sets the manner in which transparency is displayed in images.
Sets the size of the checkerboard used to display transparency.
When enabled, GIMP will not save an image if it has not been changed since it was opened.
Sets the minimal number of operations that can be undone. More undo levels are kept available until the undo-size limit is reached.
Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep operations on the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least as many undo-levels as configured can be undone.
Sets the size of the previews in the Undo History.
When enabled, pressing F1 will open the help browser.

Display information on this GNOME version
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.
Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including translations, documentation, and quality assurance.

List of profiles
List of profiles known to gnome-terminal. The list contains strings naming subdirectories relative to /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles.
Profile to use for new terminals
Profile to be used when opening a new window or tab. Must be in profile_list.
Whether the menubar has access keys
Whether to have Alt+letter access keys for the menubar. They may interfere with some applications run inside the terminal so it's possible to turn them off.
Whether the standard GTK shortcut for menubar access is enabled
Normally you can access the menubar with F10. This can also be customized via gtkrc (gtk-menu-bar-accel = "whatever"). This option allows the standard menubar accelerator to be disabled.
[UTF-8,current]
List of available encodings
A subset of possible encodings are presented in the Encoding submenu. This is a list of encodings to appear there. The special encoding name "current" means to display the encoding of the current locale.
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing terminal windows
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing a terminal window which has more than one open tab.
Default
Human-readable name of the profile
Human-readable name of the profile.
Whether to show menubar in new windows/tabs
True if the menubar should be shown in new windows, for windows/tabs with this profile.
Default color of text in the terminal
Default color of text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of terminal background
Default color of terminal background, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
What to do with dynamic title
If the application in the terminal sets the title (most typically people have their shell set up to do this), the dynamically-set title can erase the configured title, go before it, go after it, or replace it. The possible values are "replace", "before", "after", and "ignore".
Title for terminal
Title to display for the terminal window or tab. This title may be replaced by or combined with the title set by the application inside the terminal, depending on the title_mode setting.
Whether to allow bold text
If true, allow applications in the terminal to make text boldface.
Whether to silence terminal bell
If true, don't make a noise when applications send the escape sequence for the terminal bell.
Characters that are considered "part of a word"
When selecting text by word, sequences of these characters are considered single words. Ranges can be given as "A-Z". Literal hyphen (not expressing a range) should be the first character given.
Position of the scrollbar
Number of lines to keep in scrollback
Whether to scroll to the bottom when a key is pressed
If true, pressing a key jumps the scrollbar to the bottom.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when there's new output
If true, whenever there's new output the terminal will scroll to the bottom.
What to do with the terminal when the child command exits
Possible values are "close" to close the terminal, and "restart" to restart the command.
Whether to launch the command in the terminal as a login shell
If true, the command inside the terminal will be launched as a login shell. (argv[0] will have a hyphen in front of it.)
Whether to update login records when launching terminal command
If true, the system login records utmp and wtmp will be updated when the command inside the terminal is launched.
Whether to run a custom command instead of the shell
If true, the value of the custom_command setting will be used in place of running a shell.
Whether to blink the cursor
Custom command to use instead of the shell
Run this command in place of the shell, if use_custom_command is true.
Icon for terminal window
Icon to use for tabs/windows containing this profile.
Palette for terminal applications
Terminals have a 16-color palette that applications inside the terminal can use. This is that palette, in the form of a colon-separated list of color names. Color names should be in hex format e.g. "#FF00FF"
Font
An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".
Background type
Background image
Filename of a background image.
Whether to scroll background image
If true, scroll the background image with the foreground text; if false, keep the image in a fixed position and scroll the text above it.
How much to darken the background image
A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to darken the background image. 0.0 means no darkness, 1.0 means fully dark. In the current implementation, there are only two levels of darkness possible, so the setting behaves as a boolean, where 0.0 disables the darkening effect.
Effect of the Backspace key
Sets what code the backspace key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.
Effect of the Delete key
Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.
Whether to use the colors from the theme for the terminal widget
If true, the theme color scheme used for text entry boxes will be used for the terminal, instead of colors provided by the user.
Whether to use the system font
If true, the terminal will use the desktop-global standard font if it's monospace (and the most similar font it can come up with otherwise).

Window manager warning:
Window manager error:
Metacity
Window %s sets SM_CLIENT_ID on itself, instead of on the WM_CLIENT_LEADER window as specified in the ICCCM.
Window %s sets an MWM hint indicating it isn't resizable, but sets min size %d x %d and max size %d x %d; this doesn't make much sense.
Application set a bogus _NET_WM_PID %lu
%s (on %s)
Invalid WM_TRANSIENT_FOR window 0x%lx specified for %s.
Window 0x%lx has property %s that was expected to have type %s format %d and actually has type %s format %d n_items %d. This is most likely an application bug, not a window manager bug. The window has title="%s" class="%s" name="%s"
Property %s on window 0x%lx contained invalid UTF-8
Property %s on window 0x%lx contained invalid UTF-8 for item %d in the list
Compositing Manager
Determines whether Metacity is a compositing manager.
If true, trade off usability for less resource usage
If true, metacity will give the user less feedback by using wireframes, avoiding animations, or other means. This is a significant reduction in usability for many users, but may allow legacy applications to continue working, and may also be a useful tradeoff for terminal servers. However, the wireframe feature is disabled when accessibility is on.

Accessibility in Kubuntu
We want to make computers work for everyone, whatever your physical circumstances. So, we provide tools that make Kubuntu one of the most accessible operating systems around.
You can get at these tools in one place: the Accessibility preferences, inside the System Settings application from the menu. From there, you can turn on helpful tools like Modifier Keys, Keyboard Filters, and Activation Gestures.
Get your game on with Kubuntu
With hundreds of game titles in our online repository, Kubuntu allows you to not be all about work, but also allows you to play.
The KDE Software Compilation has quite a few games ranging from card games to logic games and board games.
Getting help with Kubuntu
If you need help, try Help from the menu, or the Help menu in most applications.
