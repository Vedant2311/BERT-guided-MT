Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination device, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,....) Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Use BPC
The Black Point Compensation (BPC) feature works in conjunction with Relative Colorimetric Intent. With Perceptual Intent, it should make no difference, since BPC is always on, and with Absolute Colorimetric, Intent it is always turned off. BPC compensates for a lack of ICC profiles for rendering dark tones. With BPC the dark tones are optimally mapped (no clipping) from original the medium to the destination rendering medium, e. g. the combination of paper and ink.
Rendering Intent:
Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination media, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...). Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

Red Filter
Black & White with Red Filter: Simulate black and white film exposure using a red filter. This creates dramatic sky effects, and simulates moonlight scenes in the daytime.
Yellow Filter
Black & White with Yellow Filter: Simulate black and white film exposure using a yellow filter. This has the most natural tonal correction, and improves contrast. Ideal for landscapes.
Yellow-Green Filter
Blue Filter
Black & White with Blue Filter: Simulate black and white film exposure using a blue filter. This accentuates haze and fog. Used for dye transfer and contrast effects.
Here, set the strength adjustment of the lens filter.
No Tone Filter
No Tone Filter: Do not apply a tone filter to the image.
Sepia Tone
Black & White with Sepia Tone: Gives a warm highlight and mid-tone while adding a bit of coolness to the shadows - very similar to the process of bleaching a print and re-developing in a sepia toner.
Brown Tone
Black & White with Brown Tone: This filter is more neutral than the Sepia Tone filter.
Cold Tone
Black & White with Cold Tone: Start subtly and replicate printing on a cold tone black and white paper such as a bromide enlarging paper.
Selenium Tone
Black & White with Selenium Tone: This effect replicates traditional selenium chemical toning done in the darkroom.
Platinum Tone
Black & White with Platinum Tone: This effect replicates traditional platinum chemical toning done in the darkroom.

Auto Correction
The auto-color correction tool preview is shown here. Picking a color on the image will show the corresponding color level on the histogram.
Auto Levels
Auto Levels: This option maximizes the tonal range in the Red, Green, and Blue channels. It searches the image shadow and highlight limit values and adjusts the Red, Green, and Blue channels to a full histogram range.
Normalize
Normalize: This option scales brightness values across the active image so that the darkest point becomes black, and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without altering its hue. This is often a "magic fix" for images that are dim or washed out.
Equalize
Equalize: This option adjusts the brightness of colors across the active image so that the histogram for the value channel is as nearly as possible flat, that is, so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as each other value. Sometimes Equalize works wonderfully at enhancing the contrasts in an image. Other times it gives garbage. It is a very powerful operation, which can either work miracles on an image or destroy it.
Stretch Contrast
Stretch Contrast: This option enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by stretching the lowest and highest values to their fullest range, adjusting everything in between.
Auto Exposure
Auto Exposure: This option enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image to calculate optimal exposition and black level using image histogram properties.

NoiseReduction
Radius: this control selects the gliding window size used for the filter. Larger values do not increase the amount of time needed to filter each pixel in the image but can cause blurring. This window moves across the image, and the color in it is smoothed to remove imperfections. In any case it must be about the same size as the noise granularity or somewhat more. If it is set higher than necessary, then it can cause unwanted blur.
Threshold: use the slider for coarse adjustment, and the spin control for fine adjustment to control edge detection sensitivity. This value should be set so that edges and details are clearly visible and noise is smoothed out. Adjustment must be made carefully, because the gap between "noisy", "smooth", and "blur" is very small. Adjust it as carefully as you would adjust the focus of a camera.
Texture:
Texture: this control sets the texture accuracy. This value can be used, to get more or less texture accuracy. When decreased, then noise and texture are blurred out, when increased then texture is amplified, but also noise will increase. It has almost no effect on image edges.
Sharpness: This value improves the frequency response for the filter. When it is too strong then not all noise can be removed, or spike noise may appear. Set it near to maximum, if you want to remove very weak noise or JPEG-artifacts, without losing detail.
Edge Lookahead:
Edge: This value defines the pixel distance to which the filter looks ahead for edges. When this value is increased, then spike noise is erased. You can eventually re-adjust the Edge filter, when you have changed this setting. When this value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer accurately track image details, and noise or blurring can occur.
Erosion:
Erosion: Use this to increase edge noise erosion and spike noise erosion (noise is removed by erosion).
Luminance: this control sets the luminance tolerance of the image. Using either the Color or the Luminance tolerance settings to make an image correction is recommended, but not both at the same time. These settings do not influence the main smoothing process controlled by the Details settings.
Color: this control sets the color tolerance of the image. It is recommended using either the Color or the Luminance tolerance to make image correction, not both at the same time. These settings do not influence the main smoothing process controlled by the Details settings.
Gamma: this control sets the gamma tolerance of the image. This value can be used to increase the tolerance values for darker areas (which commonly are noisier). This results in more blur for shadow areas.
Damping:
Damping: this control sets the phase-jitter damping adjustment. This value defines how fast the adaptive filter-radius reacts to luminance variations. If increased, then edges appear smoother; if too high, then blur may occur. If at minimum, then noise and phase jitter at the edges can occur. It can suppress spike noise when increased, and this is the preferred method to remove it.

Edit the filter for finding tracks with specific attributes, e. g. a track that has a length of three minutes.
Here you can choose to Simple Search directly or to use some keywords to specify some attributes, such as the artist name and so on. The keywords selectable are divided by their specific value. Some keywords are numeric and others are alphanumeric. You do not need to know it directly. When a keyword is numeric it will be used to search the numeric data for each track. The alphanumeric keywords are the following: album, artist, filename (including path), mountpoint (e. g. / home/ user1), filetype (you can specify mp3, ogg, flac,... and the file extensions will be matched), genre, comment, composer, directory, lyrics, title, and label. The numeric keywords are: bitrate, disc/ discnumber, length (expressed in seconds), playcount, rating, samplerate, score, size/ filesize (expressed in bytes, kbytes, and megabytes as specified in the unit for the filesize keyword), track (i. e. the track number), and year.

The name of the group
The user visible name of the group. It will be shown in the structure tree as a top node when there are elements belonging to this group in the document.
& Icon:
Regular expression to get the filename
Regular expression to get the filename. The expression is used to remove the unnecessary strings from the element's text.
Filename definition:
True if the element's text contains a filename
Contains a & filename
Elements identified by this entry will belong to this group
Defines which tags belong to this group. The format is tagname(attribute1, attribute2,...). Tags with name tagname will appear under this group. The item text of the corresponding node in the tree will be attribute1_value _BAR_ attribute2_value _BAR_... Currently only one tag may be listed here.
& Tag:
The name that appears when no element were found
The user visible name of the group. It will be shown in the structure tree as a top node when there are no elements belonging to this group in the document.
"No" name:
Treat elements as new tags
Treat elements as new tags, so they will show up during tag autocompletion.
Use elements as tags
& Pseudo DTEP Specific Settings
Regular expression to find the type of the element
Regular expression to find the type of the element. The pattern is searched on the result of the DefinitionRx match and the first captured area will hold the element type. Example (simplified): DefinitionRx=\\$+([a-zA-Z]+)=new\\\\s[a-zA-Z]+; TypeRx=new\\\\s([a-zA-Z]+); This will match strings like $fooObj=new foo;. Now this string is searched and it will find new foo;, where foo is the first captured text (the regular expression matching foo is between brackets). So the type of $fooObj is foo.
Regular expression to find the usage of a group element
Regular expression to find the usage of a group element in the document. Example 1: - classes are defined as class foo {...} - classes are used as $objFoo Example 2: - variables are defined as int i - variables are used as @i Example 3: - variables are defined as $i - variables are used as $i. In this case UsageRx is the same as DefinitionRx.
& Usage expression:
Element type expression:
Regular expression to find what belong to this group
Regular expression used to find text areas in the document, which will belong to this group. The first captured area shouldbe the actual name of the group entry. Example for a class group: \\bclass[\\\\s]+([0-9a-zA-Z_\\x7f-\\xff]*)[\\\\s]* The first captured area (between "(" and ")") holds the class name.
Definition expression:
The name of the group that may be the parent of this
The name of the group that may be the parent of this. For example classes might be a parent of functions in case of member functions. This entry indicates this possible relationship and is used to provide functionality like member autocompletion.
Parent group:
Only tags of this type can be part of the group
Searched tags:
Regular expression used to remove unwanted strings from the completion text
Remove when autocompleting:
Regular expression to tell when to bring up the completion box with the elements of this group
Regular expression to tell when to bring up the completion box with the elements of this group. Example: \\bnew[\\\\s]+$ tells that after typing newnbsp;, the completion box with the elements should be shown.

Check if the DTEP can act as a top level DTEP.
Check if the DTEP can act as a top level DTEP. This means that the document can be of this type. Some pseudo DTEPs cannot act as a top level DTEP, like PHP as they are always included as part of another DTEP, while some others can be included and act as standalone as well, like the case of CSS.

Comma-separated list of the beginning and closing string for special areas
The beginning and closing string of special areas, separated by a comma. Special areas are not parsed according to this DTD's rules, but according to their own rules. A special area can be a pseudo DTD, a comment or something like that, for example lt; !--nbsp; --gt;.
Special areas:
Comma-separated list of the names for the above-defined special areas
Special area names:
Specifies a tag that defines the start of a special area
Specifies a tag which defines the start of a special area in the form of tagname(attributename). Example: script(language) means that any lt; scriptgt; tag having a language attribute indicates a special area.
Special tags:
Tags and attributes defining this DTEP
Comma-separated list of tags that define this DTEP. The format used is tagname(attribute[defaultvalue]). If the parent (a real) DTEP has a tag with tagname and the attribute value of this tag is equal with the name of this DTEP, the tag area is parsed according to the rules of this DTEP. If [defaultvalue] is present, it means that if the attribute is not present in the tag it is taken as present with value = defaultvalue. Example: Tags=style(type[text/ css]) means that both lt; stylegt; and lt; stylenbsp; type="text/ css"gt; are treated the same way and the DTEP defined by this tag is named text/ css.
Definition tags:
Comma-separated list of the area borders
Comma-separated list of the area borders encapsulating this pseudo DTEP. In the case of PHP it is: lt; ?nbsp; ?gt;, nbsp; lt; *nbsp; *gt;, nbsp; lt; %nbsp; %gt;

Structure delimiting:
A string specifying the beginning of a structure
A string specifying the beginning of a structure, like {in many cases.
Structure beginning:
Comma-separated list of the local scope defining keywords
Comma-separated list of the local scope defining keywords. Other structure group elements found under a structure node that was created based on a keyword from this list are treated as local elements. For example if this list contains function, it means that elements, like variables found under a function are local, relative to the node that holds the function.
Local scope keywords:
A string specifying the end of a structure
A string specifying the end of a structure, like} in many cases.
Structure end:
Regular expression to find out when to invoke member autocompletion
Regular expression to find out when to invoke member autocompletion. Example: - we have a class called foo with some member variables - the object of type foo is used in the document as $objFoo - the members can appear as $objFoo- > member or $objFoo. member - in the above case this entry should look like (?: -gt; _BAR_\\. )$ (autocomplete if the object is followed by -gt; or.) The regular expression must be terminated with $(match end of line).
Complete class members after:
Autocomplete attributes after this character. See the information for the same entry valid for tags.
Complete attributes after:
The character specifying the end of an attribute
The character specifying the end of an attribute. By default it is "for XML DTEPs and, for pseudo DTEPs.
Attribute separator:
Comma-separated list of DTEPs that can be present inside this DTEP
Comma-separated list of DTEPs that can be present inside this DTEP. The list consist usually of pseudo DTEPs.
Included DTEPs:

About
Quanta Plus Submitter Info Files The purpose of these files is to provide developers with proper credit, expose licensing information and give users thumbnail information about scripts and templates at a glance. We ask that you try to do several things here. Fill in all the fields. They are all there for a reason.

Mount root filesystem & read-only
Mount the root filesystem for this kernel read-only. Since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode after running some checks, this should always be turned on. Do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing.
Do not check & partition table
This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it can be useful, for example, by providing the capability of booting from a floppy disk, without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.
& Record boot command lines for defaults
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf
Restrict parameters
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf.
Require & password:
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted above is checked, the password is required for additional parameters only. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here.

LILO Configuration
(c) 2000, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkraenzer
Select...
You can edit the lilo. conf file directly here. All changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface.
Install & boot record to drive/ partition:
Select the drive or partition you want to install the LILO boot loader to here. Unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to LILO, this should be the MBR (master boot record) of your boot drive. In this case, you should probably select / dev/ hda if your boot drive is an IDE drive or / dev/ sda if your boot drive is SCSI.
Boot the default kernel/ OS & after:
/ 10 seconds
LILO will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel (or OS) marked as default in the Images tab.
Use & linear mode
Check this box if you want to use the linear mode. Linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector/ head/ cylinder. Linear mode is required for some SCSI drives, and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer. See the lilo. conf man page for details.
Use & compact mode
Check this box if you want to use the compact mode. The compact mode tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This reduces load time and keeps the boot map smaller, but will not work on all systems.
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf.
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted is checked above, the password is only required for additional parameters. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
& Default graphics mode on text console:
You can select the default graphics mode here. If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode, you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices. The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter LILO & prompt automatically
If this box is checked, LILO goes to the LILO prompt whether or not a key is pressed. If it is turned off, LILO boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed (in that case, it goes to the LILO prompt). This sets the prompt option in lilo. conf.
This is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot. Select which one you want to edit here.
& Kernel:
Enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Label:
Enter the label (name) of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Root filesystem:
Enter the root filesystem (i. e. the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time) for the kernel you want to boot here.
& Initial ramdisk:
If you want to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) for this kernel, enter its filename here. Leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel.
Extra parameters:
Enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here. Usually, this can be left blank. This sets the append option in lilo. conf.

Unmount Tape
KDat will dump your files properly to tape, but may not be able to restore them. To restore your files by hand, you need to know the name of the *non-rewinding* version of your tape device %1.
For example, if your device is / dev/ st0, the non-rewinding version is / dev/ nst0. If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory. Please let us know if this happens to you. - KDat Maintenance Team

Description:
IP address of the network device
Broadcast:
Simply enter a short human-readable description for this device
The Broadcast is a special address. All devices of a network respond if packages are sent to this address.
Configure Interface
TCP/ IP Address
Netmask:
The netmask defines a range of IP numbers which will build a subnet inside the network.
IP address:
An IP address is an unique identifier of a networking device in an TCP/ IP network
IP address for the network device
Here you should enter the IP address for the network interface. Please note: If your network is connected to the internet, you should only enter IP addresses you have been given by your provider. Otherwise, you should enter one of the IP addresses which are explicitly reserved for private use. Most small private networks use class C networks, which allow up to 255 computers in your network. So simply use addresses like 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.171 and so on for your computers. Class C networks: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, for example 192.168.0.13. Class B networks: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, for example 172.28.2.5 Class A networks: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, for example 10.5.12.14 Please ensure that all IP addresses you give to your computers are unique; you will have many problems if the same address is assigned to more than one network device.
Subnetmask of the network device
Please enter the desired subnetmask for the interface here. For small private networks, 255.255.255.0 will most often be a reasonable default value. This field will change from a popup box to a combo box as soon as you enable the advanced settings below.
255.255.255.0
255.255.0.0
255.0.0.0

Manual:
Use a static IP address. Use the fields below to enter the values
Sets this interface to use static IP settings. In this case, please use the fields below to enter the desired values manually.
Automatic:
Use a dynamic IP address
Using an dynamic IP address causes this device to get a free IP address automatically. The interface will try to contact an DHCP- or BOOTP-Server during the boot process. Rendevouz is not supported yet.

You have specified that your system's init scripts are located in the folder %1, but this folder does not exist. You probably selected the wrong distribution during configuration. If you reconfigure %2, it may be possible to fix the problem. If you choose to reconfigure, you should shut down the application and the configuration wizard will appear the next time %3 is run. If you choose not to reconfigure, you will not be able to view or edit your system's init configuration. Would you like to reconfigure %4?

You do not have the right permissions to edit your system's init configuration. However, you are free to browse the runlevels. If you really want to edit the configuration, either restart %1 as root (or another privileged user), or ask your sysadmin to install %2 suid or sgid. The latter way is not recommended though, due to security issues.

The source of the user and group database
This option allows you to select where the user/ group data stored. Currently three storage backends are supported. Files stores user/ group data in traditional / etc/ passwd and / etc/ group flat files. LDAP stores data in a directory server using the posixAccount and posixGroup object classes; this backend allows the management of Samba users/ groups via the sambaSamAccount object class. System provides a read-only access to all users and groups which your installation knows about.
Shell
This option allows you to select the shell which will be the default for new users.
Home path template
This option specifies the UNIX home path template for new users. The '%U 'macro will replaced with the actual user name.
First UID
This options specifies the first user ID where searching for an available UID starts.
First GID
This options specifies the first group ID where searching for an available GID starts.
If this option is checked then a home directory will created for the new user.
If this option is checked then the contents of the skeleton folder will copied to the new user's home directory
If this option is enabled, new user creation will create a private group named as the user, and the primary group of the user will assigned to this private group.
Default primary group
This is the default primary group which will be assigned to a newly created user.
smin
smax
swarn
sinact
sexpire
This setting is for specifying a date when user accounts will expire.
sneverexpire
Check this if you want to user accounts never expire.
Password file
This specifies the users database file (usually / etc/ passwd).
Group file
This specifies the groups database file (usually / etc/ group).
MD5 Shadow passwords
Check this if you want the passwords in the shadow file MD5 hashed. Leave this unchecked if DES encryption should be used.
Shadow password file
Specifies the shadow password file (usually / etc/ shadow). Leave this empty if your system does not use a shadow password file.
Group shadow file
Specifies the shadow group file (usually / etc/ gshadow). Leave this empty if your system does not use a shadow group file.

LDAP Group container
This specifies where to store groups' entries relative to the LDAP base DN.
LDAP Group filter
This specifies the filter used for group entries.
LDAP User RDN prefix
This specifies what prefix will used for user entries.
Check this if the user's full name should be stored in the cn (Canonical Name) attribute.
Update the gecos field
Check this if the gecos attribute should be updated.
Manage LDAP shadowAccount objectclass
Check this if the shadowAccount object should be used in the users' entries. It allows to enforce password change/ expiration policies.
LDAP Structural objectclass
This option allows to specify the structural objectclass used with users' entries. If you want to use these entries not just for authentication, but for an address book, too, then choose inetOrgPerson.
LDAP Group RDN prefix
This specifies what prefix will used for group entries.
LDAP Password hash method
This specifies the password hashing method. The most secure is SSHA.
Enable samba account management
Check this if you want to use the user/ group entries in a Samba domain. KUser will create sambaSamAccount objectclass for each entry which is usable with the ldapsam passdb backend with Samba version greater than 3.0.
Samba domain name
This specifies the samba domain name.
Samba domain SID
This specifies the domain Security IDentifier. It is unique in a single domain. You can query the value of the domain SID with'net getlocalsid domain_name '.
Algorithmic RID base
This value is an offset for the algorithmic mapping from uids and gids to rids. The default (and minimum) value is 1000, it must be even, and the LDAP database and smb. conf must store the same values.
Samba login script
This specifies a name of a login script (in the ` Netlogon ` share) which will be executed as the user logs in to a Windows machine.
Samba home drive
Specifies a drive letter where the user's home directory will automatically mapped when he/ she logs into a Windows machine.
Samba profile path template
This specifies the location of the roaming profile of the user. The '%U 'macro will be replaced with the actual user name.
Samba home path template
This specifies the location of the home directory of the user. This field is meaningful only for Windows machines. The '%U 'macro will be replaced with the actual user name.
Store the LanManager hashed password in the sambaLMPassword attribute. Check this if you have older clients (Win9x series and before) on your network.

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.

In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."

This takes an image, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one of those "fifteen-puzzle" games where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Fifteen_puzzle Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1994.
Slip
This throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them through a jet engine and spews them out the other side. To avoid turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will it interject some splashes of color into the scene, or go into a spin cycle, or stretch the image like taffy.

This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.

This makes collages out of random images pulled off of the World Wide Web. It finds these images by doing random web searches, and then extracting images from the returned pages. WARNING: THE INTERNET SOMETIMES CONTAINS PORNOGRAPHY. The Internet being what it is, absolutely anything might show up in the collage including -- quite possibly -- pornography, or even nudity. Please act accordingly. See also http: / /www. jwz. org/ webcollage/ Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.

Examples
After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.

After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!

Show file in embedded viewer
Show file in separate viewer
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file belonging to this group. Konqueror can display the file in an embedded viewer or start up a separate application. You can change this setting for a specific file type in the'Embedding 'tab of the file type configuration. Dolphin shows files always in a separate viewer
This button displays the icon associated with the selected file type. Click on it to choose a different icon.
This is the icon associated with the selected file type. Choosing a different icon requires shared-mime-info to be at least version 0.40.
Filename Patterns
This box contains a list of patterns that can be used to identify files of the selected type. For example, the pattern *. txt is associated with the file type'text/ plain '; all files ending in'. txt 'are recognized as plain text files.

Description:
You can enter a short description for files of the selected file type (e. g. 'HTML Page '). This description will be used by applications like Konqueror to display directory content.
Ask whether to save to disk instead (only for Konqueror browser)
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type. Konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer, or start up a separate application. If set to'Use settings for G group ', the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group G to which this type belongs; for instance, 'image' if the current file type is image/ png. Dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.
Find file type or filename pattern
Enter a part of a filename pattern, and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list. Alternatively, enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list.
Known Types
Here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system. Click on the '+ 'sign to expand a category, or the '-' sign to collapse it. Select a file type (e. g. text/ html for HTML files) to view/ edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right.

Use customized bell
If this option is checked, the default system bell will be used. See the "System Bell" control module for how to customize the system bell. Normally, this is just a "beep".
Check this option if you want to use a customized bell, playing a sound file. If you do this, you will probably want to turn off the system bell. Please note that on slow machines this may cause a "lag" between the event causing the bell and the sound being played.
Sound & to play:

If the option "Use customized bell" is enabled, you can choose a sound file here. Click "Browse..." to choose a sound file using the file dialog.
Visible Bell
& Use visible bell
This option will turn on the "visible bell", i. e. a visible notification shown every time that normally just a bell would occur. This is especially useful for deaf people.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Force fonts DPI:
96 DPI
120 DPI
This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.
Some changes such as anti-aliasing will only affect newly started applications.

This graph gives you an overview of the total sum of physical and virtual memory in your system.
Physical Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.
Swap Space
The swap space is the virtual memory available to the system. It will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and/ or swap files.

Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse, trackball, or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
& General
If you are left-handed, you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the'left-handed 'option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons, only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example, if you have a three-button mouse, the middle button is unaffected.
The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device. This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers. If you would prefer to select with a single click, and activate with a double click, check this option.
Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click.
If you check this option, pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon. This may be useful when single clicks activate icons, and you want only to select the icon without activating it.
If you have checked the option to automatically select icons, this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected.
& Cursor Theme
Advanced
Pointer acceleration:
This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.
Pointer threshold:
The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.
msec
Double click interval:
The double click interval is the maximal time (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click. If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click, they are recognized as two separate clicks.
Drag start time:
If you click with the mouse (e. g. in a multi-line editor) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time, a drag operation will be initiated.
Drag start distance:
If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance, a drag operation will be initiated.
Mouse wheel scrolls by:
If you use the wheel of a mouse, this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement. Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines, it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

Keyboard Repeat
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

Cache This module lets you configure your cache settings. The cache is an internal memory in Konqueror where recently read web pages are stored. If you want to retrieve a web page again that you have recently read, it will not be downloaded from the Internet, but rather retrieved from the cache, which is a lot faster.

& Management
Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

Reject the so called third-party cookies. These are cookies that originate from a site other than the one you are currently browsing. For example, if you visit www. foobar. com while this option is on, only cookies that originate from www. foobar. com will be processed per your settings. Cookies from any other site will be rejected. This reduces the chances of site operators compiling a profile about your daily browsing habits.
Only accept cookies from originating server
Automatically accept temporary cookies meant to expire at the end of the current session. Such cookies will not be stored in your computer's hard drive or storage device. Instead, they are deleted when you close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. NOTE: Checking this option along with the next one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Automatically accept session cookies
Treat all cookies as session cookies. Session cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory until you quit or close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. Unlike regular cookies, session cookies are never stored on your hard drive or other storage medium. NOTE: Checking this option along with the previous one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Duplicate Identification
Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.
Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker.

The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

Behavior This module allows you to choose various options for your desktop, including the way in which icons are arranged and the pop-up menus associated when clicking on the desktop using the middle and right mouse buttons. Use the "What's This?" (Shift+F1) to get help on specific options.
General
Uncheck this option if you do not want to have icons on the desktop. Without icons the desktop will be somewhat faster but you will no longer be able to drag files to the desktop.
& Show icons on desktop
Check this option if you want to run X11 programs that draw into the desktop such as xsnow, xpenguin or xmountain. If you have problems with applications like netscape that check the root window for running instances, disable this option.

File Icons
Check this option if you want to see your icons automatically aligned to the grid when you move them.
Automatically & line up icons
If you check this option, any files in your desktop directory that begin with a period (.) will be shown. Usually, such files contain configuration information, and remain hidden from view. For example, files which are named ". directory" are plain text files which contain information for Konqueror, such as the icon to use in displaying a directory, the order in which files should be sorted, etc. You should not change or delete these files unless you know what you are doing.

Show Introduction Page
Show My Home Page
Show Blank Page
Show My Bookmarks
Home page:
Select Home Page
This is the URL of the web page where Konqueror (as web browser) will jump to when the "Home" button is pressed. When Konqueror is started as a file manager, that button makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
Konqueror Browser Here you can configure Konqueror's browser functionality. Please note that the file manager functionality has to be configured using the "File Manager" configuration module. You can make some settings how Konqueror should handle the HTML code in the web pages it loads. It is usually not necessary to change anything here.
Bookmarks
Ask for name and folder when adding bookmarks
If this box is checked, Konqueror will allow you to change the title of the bookmark and choose a folder in which to store it when you add a new bookmark.
Show only marked bookmarks in bookmark toolbar
If this box is checked, Konqueror will show only those bookmarks in the bookmark toolbar which you have marked to do so in the bookmark editor.
Form Completion
If this box is checked, Konqueror will remember the data you enter in web forms and suggest it in similar fields for all forms.
& Maximum completions:
Here you can select how many values Konqueror will remember for a form field.
Mouse Behavior
Change cursor over links
If this option is set, the shape of the cursor will change (usually to a hand) if it is moved over a hyperlink.
Middle click opens URL in selection
If this box is checked, you can open the URL in the selection by middle clicking on a Konqueror view.
Right click goes & back in history
If this box is checked, you can go back in history by right clicking on a Konqueror view. To access the context menu, press the right mouse button and move.
Allow automatic delayed & reloading/ redirecting
Some web pages request an automatic reload or redirection after a certain period of time. By unchecking this box Konqueror will ignore these requests.

Click this button to choose the file that contains the Java policies. These policies will be merged with the existing ones. Duplicate entries are ignored.
Click this button to save the Java policy to a zipped file. The file, named java_policy. tgz, will be saved to a location of your choice.
Here you can set specific Java policies for any particular host or domain. To add a new policy, simply click the New... button and supply the necessary information requested by the dialog box. To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy, causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/. java. policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enabling this will cause the jvm to use KIO for network transport
Enter the path to the java executable. If you want to use the jre in your path, simply leave it as'java '. If you need to use a different jre, enter the path to the java executable (e. g. / usr/ lib/ jdk/ bin/ java), or the path to the directory that contains'bin/ java' (e. g. / opt/ IBMJava2-13).
If you want special arguments to be passed to the virtual machine, enter them here.
When all the applets have been destroyed, the applet server should shut down. However, starting the jvm takes a lot of time. If you would like to keep the java process running while you are browsing, you can set the timeout value to whatever you like. To keep the java process running for the whole time that the konqueror process is, leave the Shutdown Applet Server checkbox unchecked.

If you disable this, Konqueror will stop interpreting the window. open() JavaScript command. This is useful if you regularly visit sites that make extensive use of this command to pop up ad banners. Note: Disabling this option might also break certain sites that require window. open() for proper operation. Use this feature carefully.

Allow scripts to focus the window.
Ignore attempts of scripts to focus the window. The web page will think it brought the focus to the window but the actual focus will remain unchanged.
Some websites set the focus to their browser window on their own by using window. focus(). This usually leads to the window being moved to the front interrupting whatever action the user was dedicated to at that time. This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.

Allow scripts to change the text of the status bar.
Ignore attempts of scripts to change the status bar text. The web page will think it changed the text but the actual text will remain unchanged.
Some websites change the status bar text by setting window. status or window. defaultStatus, thus sometimes preventing displaying the real URLs of hyperlinks. This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.
Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 User defined stylesheets allow increased accessibility for visually handicapped people.
Expression (e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ad/ *):
Enter an expression to filter. Expressions can be defined as either a filename style wildcard e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads* or as a full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ 'e. g. / /(ad_BAR_banner)\\. /

Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Machine:
For selecting all windows belonging to a specific application, selecting only window class should usually work.
Use window & class (whole application)
For selecting a specific window in an application, both window class and window role should be selected. Window class will determine the application, and window role the specific window in the application; many applications do not provide useful window roles though.
Use window class and window & role (specific window)
With some (non-KDE) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application, as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role.
Use & whole window class (specific window)

A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.

Enable this checkbox to alter this window property for the specified window(s).
Specify how the window property should be affected: Do Not Affect: The window property will not be affected and therefore the default handling for it will be used. Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user. Windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention, which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted. This can be changed in the Notifications control module.
Focus stealing prevention level:
Click to Focus
Focus Follows Mouse
Focus Under Mouse
Focus Strictly Under Mouse
& Policy:
The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.
ms
Delay focus by:
Click raises active window
When this option is enabled, a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time.
This is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front.
When this option is enabled, the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents. To change it for inactive windows, you need to change the settings in the Actions tab.
When this option is enabled, there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active (receive focus).
This is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus.
Separate screen focus
When this option is enabled, focus operations are limited only to the active Xinerama screen
When this option is enabled, the active Xinerama screen (where new windows appear, for example) is the screen containing the mouse pointer. When disabled, the active Xinerama screen is the screen containing the focused window. By default this option is disabled for Click to focus and enabled for other focus policies.
Shading
& Enable hover
If Shade Hover is enabled, a shaded window will un-shade automatically when the mouse pointer has been over the title bar for some time.
Sets the time in milliseconds before the window unshades when the mouse pointer goes over the shaded window.

It might be useful to selectively affect placement of some windows using the window-specific settings. Cascade will cascade the windows Random will use a random position Centered will place the window centered Zero-Cornered will place the window in the top-left corner
& Placement:
Hide utility windows for inactive applications
When turned on, utility windows (tool windows, torn-off menus,...) of inactive applications will be hidden and will be shown only when the application becomes active. Note that applications have to mark the windows with the proper window type for this feature to work.

Enable this option if you want a window's content to be shown while resizing it, instead of just showing a window'skeleton '. The result may not be satisfying on slow machines.
Display window & geometry when moving or resizing
Enable this option if you want a window's geometry to be displayed while it is being moved or resized. The window position relative to the top-left corner of the screen is displayed together with its size.
Allow moving and resizing of maximized windows
When enabled, this feature activates the border of maximized windows and allows you to move or resize them, just like for normal windows

Show window list while switching windows
Hold down the Alt key and press the Tab key repeatedly to walk through the windows on the current desktop (the Alt+Tab combination can be reconfigured). If this checkbox is checked a popup widget is shown, displaying the icons of all windows to walk through and the title of the currently selected one. Otherwise, the focus is passed to a new window each time Tab is pressed, with no popup widget. In addition, the previously activated window will be sent to the back in this mode.
& Traverse windows on all desktops
Leave this option disabled if you want to limit walking through windows to the current desktop.
Desktop navigation wraps around
Enable this option if you want keyboard or active desktop border navigation beyond the edge of a desktop to take you to the opposite edge of the new desktop.

System Notifications KDE allows for a great deal of control over how you will be notified when certain events occur. There are several choices as to how you are notified: As the application was originally designed. With a beep or other noise. Via a popup dialog box with additional information. By recording the event in a logfile without any additional visual or audible alert.

Konqueror
System
Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here. These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded.
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many file browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously.
If non-zero, this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed, up to the number specified in this option. When a new Konqueror instance is needed, one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead, improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances.
If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence. This will make the first Konqueror window open faster, but at the expense of longer KDE startup times (but you will be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is taking longer).
If enabled, KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available, so that windows will always open quickly. Warning: In some cases, it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance.

System Configuration
Disable & system configuration startup check
This option may in rare cases lead to various problems. Consult the What's This (Shift+F1) help for details.
During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
Enable & polling to autodetect card events
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.
Automatically & launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
When you insert a smartcard, KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card.

smartcard This module allows you to configure KDE support for smartcards. These can be used for various tasks such as storing SSL certificates and logging in to the system.
Session Manager You can configure the session manager here. This includes options such as whether or not the session exit (logout) should be confirmed, whether the session should be restored again when logging in and whether the computer should be automatically shut down after session exit by default.
General
Check this option if you want the session manager to display a logout confirmation dialog box.
Confirm logout
Offer shutdown options
Here you can choose what should happen by default when you log out. This only has meaning, if you logged in through KDM.

& Turn off computer
& Restart computer
Restore previous session: Will save all applications running on exit and restore them when they next start up Restore manually saved session: Allows the session to be saved at any time via "Save Session" in the K-Menu. This means the currently started applications will reappear when they next start up. Start with an empty session: Do not save anything. Will come up with an empty desktop on next start.

Applications to be excluded from sessions:

Menu translucency is not available.
Menu drop-shadows are not available.
If you check this box, you can select several effects for different widgets like combo boxes, menus or tooltips.
Disable: do not use any combo box effects. Animate: Do some animation.
Disable: do not use any tooltip effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in tooltips using alpha-blending.
Disable: do not use any menu effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in menus using alpha-blending. Make Translucent: Alpha-blend menus for a see-through effect. (KDE styles only)
When enabled, all popup menus will have a drop-shadow, otherwise drop-shadows will not be displayed. At present, only KDE styles can have this effect enabled.
Software Tint: Alpha-blend using a flat color. Software Blend: Alpha-blend using an image. XRender Blend: Use the XFree RENDER extension for image blending (if available). This method may be slower than the Software routines on non-accelerated displays, but may however improve performance on remote displays.
By adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity.
Note: that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to Qt-only applications.
If you check this box, the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around.
If you enable this option some pop-up menus will show so called tear-off handles. If you click them, you get the menu inside a widget. This can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times.

kdialog: could not open file %1
Enable background
If this is checked, KDM will use the settings below for the background. If it is disabled, you have to look after the background yourself. This is done by running some program (possibly xsetroot) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc (usually Xsetup).
Enable Auto-Login
Turn on the auto-login feature. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
User:
Select the user to be logged in automatically.
Lock session
The automatically started session will be locked immediately (provided it is a KDE session). This can be used to obtain a super-fast login restricted to one user.
Preselect User
& None
Previous
Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Specified:
Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right. Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
When this option is on, KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user. Use this to save one key press per login, if the preselection usually does not need to be changed.
Enable Password-Less Logins
When this option is checked, the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
No password required for:
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Miscellaneous
Automatically log in again after & X server crash
When this option is on, a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an X server crash; note that this can open a security hole: if you use a screen locker than KDE's integrated one, this will make circumventing a password-secured screen lock possible.
& Greeting:
This is the "headline" for KDM's login window. You may want to put some nice greeting or information about the operating system here. KDM will substitute the following character pairs with the respective contents: %d - > current display %h - > host name, possibly with domain name %n - > node name, most probably the host name without domain name %s - > the operating system %r - > the operating system's version %m - > the machine (hardware) type%% - > a single%

KDM - Dialog Here you can configure the basic appearance of the KDM login manager in dialog mode, i. e. a greeting string, an icon etc.

Here you can choose the language used by KDM. This setting does not affect a user's personal settings; that will take effect after login.
& Use themed greeter
Enable this if you would like to use a themed Login Manager.

GUI style:
You can choose a basic GUI style here that will be used by KDM only.
Color scheme:
You can choose a basic Color Scheme here that will be used by KDM only.
This changes the font which is used for all the text in the login manager except for the greeting and failure messages.

Greeting:
Use anti-aliasing for fonts
If you check this box and your X-Server has the Xft extension, fonts will be antialiased (smoothed) in the login dialog.

Here you can select who is allowed to shutdown the computer using KDM. You can specify different values for local (console) and remote displays. Possible values are: Everybody: everybody can shutdown the computer using KDM Only root: KDM will only allow shutdown after the user has entered the root password Nobody: nobody can shutdown the computer using KDM

Inverse selection
This option specifies how the users for "Show list" and "Autocompletion" are selected in the "Select users and groups" list: If not checked, select only the checked users. If checked, select all non-system users, except the checked ones.

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.
& General
& Dialog
There is no login dialog window in themed mode.
& Background
The background cannot be configured separately in themed mode.
& Theme
Themed mode is disabled. See "General" tab.
& Shutdown
& Users
& Convenience
Drag the anchor to move the center of the dialog to the desired position. Keyboard control is possible as well: Use the arrow keys or Home to center. Note that the actual proportions of the dialog are probably different.

KIO Client
Command-line tool for network-transparent operations
Syntax:
kioclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kioclient exec'url '['mimetype'] # Tries to open the document pointed to by'url ', in the application # associated with it in KDE. You may omit'mimetype'. # In this case the mimetype is determined # automatically. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file. # 'url 'can be an executable, too.
kioclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user-specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kioclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient cat'url '# Writes out the contents of'url' to stdout
kioclient remove'url '# Removes the URL # 'url' may be a list of URLs.
*** Examples: kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop "Mount default" / / Mounts the CDROM
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kioclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop / / Opens the CDROM's mount directory
kioclient exec. / / Opens the current directory. Very convenient.

Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.
Klipper - clipboard tool
Action list (right click to add/ remove commands):
Double-click here to set the command to be executed
Double-click here to set the regular expression
Selecting this option synchronizes these two buffers.
Using this option will only set the selection when highlighting something and the clipboard when choosing e. g. "Copy" in a menubar.
& Use graphical editor for editing regular expressions
Click on a highlighted item's column to change it. "%s" in a command will be replaced with the clipboard contents.

Search the Web
Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy. You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews.
Konqueror is also a full featured and easy to use web browser which you can use to explore the Internet. Enter the address (e. g. http: / /www. kde. org) of a web page you would like to visit in the location bar and press Enter, or choose an entry from the Bookmarks menu.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Next: Tips & Tricks
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:

Tips & Tricks
Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page.
When you want to paste a new address into the Location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar.
To create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page, simply drag the "Location" label that is to the left of the Location toolbar, drop it on to the desktop, and choose "Link".
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser (and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster!)

... that you can get a'Linux console-like 'terminal? Hide Konsole's menubar, tabbar and scrollbar, select the Linux font and the Linux Colors schema and apply the full-screen mode. You might also want to set the KDE panel to auto-hide.
... that you can rename your Konsole sessions by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting "Rename session"? The change will be reflected in the Konsole tabbar, making it easier to remember the content of the session.
... that you can rename a Konsole session by double-clicking its tab?

... that you can let Konsole set the current directory as the session name? For Bash, put'export PS1=$PS1"\\[\\e]30; \\H: \\w\\a\\] "'in your ~/. bashrc.
... that if you let your shell pass the current directory to Konsole within the prompt variable, e. g. for Bash with'export PS1=$PS1"\\[\\e]31; \\w\\a\\] "'in your ~/. bashrc, then Konsole can bookmark it, and session management will remember your current working directory on non-Linux systems too?
... that double-clicking will select a whole word? When you do n't release the mouse button after the second click you can extend your selection by additional words when moving the mouse.
... that triple-clicking will select a whole line? When you do n't release the mouse button after the third click you can extend your selection by additional lines when moving the mouse.
... that if you drag & drop a URL into a Konsole window you are presented with a menu giving the option to copy or move the specified file into the current working directory, as well as just pasting the URL as text. This works with any type of URL which KDE supports.

... that right-clicking over the "New" button in the left corner of the tabbar or in an empty tabbar space displays a menu where you can set several tab options?

Shortcuts
None
In this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature. Web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the Internet. For example, to search for information about the KDE project using the Google engine, you simply type gg: KDE or google: KDE. If you select a default search engine, normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications, such as Konqueror, that have built-in support for such a feature.
Search Filters
Enable shortcuts that allow you to quickly search for information on the web. For example, entering the shortcut gg: KDE will result in a search for the word KDE on the Google(TM) search engine.
& Enable Web shortcuts

Select the search engine to use for input boxes that provide automatic lookup services when you type in normal words and phrases instead of a URL. To disable this feature select None from the list.
Default & search engine:
Choose the delimiter that separates the keyword from the phrase or word to be searched.
& Keyword delimiter:
Colon
Space
Enter the human-readable name of the search provider here.
Search & provider name:
Enter the URI that is used to perform a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string, whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & URI:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search
URI shortcuts:

Keyboard Layout Here you can choose your keyboard layout and model. The'model 'refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer, while the keyboard layout defines "which key does what" and may be different for different countries.
Keyboard & model:
Here you can choose a keyboard model. This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the "hardware" model, i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models, which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.
Available layouts:
...
Active layouts:
Command:
Layout variant:
Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout. Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language. For example, Ukrainian layout might have four variants: basic, winkeys (as in Windows), typewriter (as in typewriters) and phonetic (each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one).

State of matter
Form of a substance; dependant on form stability and whether it takes up a definite volume: solid, liquid or gaseous.
Boiling point
Melting point
Chemical Symbol
One, two, or three letter abbreviation; set through international convention.
Chromatography
Matter separation in a moving medium (mobile phase) through differentiated absorption on a static medium (stationary phase).
Distillation
Separation of a liquid solution (homogeneous mix) into its components through evaporation and condensation. In a fractionary distillation the process is repeated several times in a column.
Matter that cannot be broken down into simpler matter. Chemical elements are cornerstones of Materials. Elements consist of atoms that consist of a nucleus of positive protons, neutral neutrons, and a shell of electrons.
Emulsion
Heterogeneous mix of two liquids.
Extraction
Processing a homogeneous or heterogeneous mix to get pure matter.
Mix
Filtering
Separation of a solid matter from a liquid matter or gaseous matter with a filter (porous separation wall).
Matter consisting of differentiated matter, combined in non-set ratios. [i]Homogeneous mixes[/ i] have a coherent look, [i]heterogeneous mixes[/ i] consist of multiple phases.
Accuracy
Consisting of accidental and systematic errors.
Law of Conservation of Mass
During a chemical reaction mass is neither lost nor gained. The sum mass of the material going into the reaction equals the sum of the mass of the products of the reaction.
Law of multiple proportions
An alloy always contains the same elements in the same mass ratio. Should two or more elements bind together then the mass ratio is constant.
Crystallization
Separation of solid, crystalline matter from a solution, or the liquid or gaseous phases.
Solution
Homogeneous mix of multiple pure materials
Measurement of an amount of matter.
Matter
All that takes up space and has mass.
Phase
Through chemical composition and physical attributes, homogeneous portion of matter that separated from its environment in its expansion through a surface.
Accuracy and precision
Expressed through standard deviation: Values given over accidental errors.
Correctness
Values given over accidental errors.
SI-Unit
Measurement unit using International Symbols.
Significant figures
The number of digits which are meaningful in a number.
Standard deviation
An amount with which the precision of a measurement can be estimated.
Suspension
Heterogeneous mix consisting of a liquid and solid matter.
Alloys
Pure matter consisting of multiple elements in a set ratio.
Alpha rays
Rays consisting of alpha particles, consisting of two protons and two neutrons that are emitted from the Atoms of certain radioactive elements.
Atom
Atoms are chemically inseparable and building blocks of matter. Atoms of one kind are called an Element.
Electron
Proton
Neutron
Atomic nucleus
The small, positively-charged center of an Atom, in which Protons and Neutrons are found.
Atomic Mass
Mass of an atom, taken on a scale where the mass of a carbon atom is 12u. In elements that consist of different isotopes the mid-range mass of the isotope mix is given.
Isotope
Isotopes are forms of a chemical element whose nuclei have the same atomic number, Z, but different atomic masses, A. The word isotope, meaning at the same place, comes from the fact that all isotopes of an element are located at the same place on the periodic table.
Spin
Magnetic Moment
Decay Mode
Decay Energy
The decay energy is the energy released by a nuclear decay.
Nuclides
[i]see isotopes[/ i]
Isotone
Nuclear Isomer
Isobars
Two nuclides are isotones if they have the same number N of neutrons.
Isobar
Isobars are nuclides having the same mass number, i. e. sum of protons plus neutrons.
Beta rays

Cathode Rays
Cathode rays are streams of electrons observed in vacuum tubes, i. e. evacuated glass tubes that are equipped with at least two electrodes, a cathode (negative electrode) and an anode (positive electrode) in a configuration known as a diode.
Ionic Radius
The Ionic Radius is the radius of a charged atom, known as an ion. The ion can have a positive or a negative charge. The charge of the ion with the radius shown is also displayed in Kalzium. A positive ion has fewer electrons in its shell than the atom, a negative ion has more electrons. Therefore, a positive ion has a smaller radius than its atom and vice versa.
The van der Waals radius of an atom is the radius of an imaginary hard sphere which can be used to model the atom for many purposes. Van der Waals radii are determined from measurements of atomic spacing between pairs of unbonded atoms in crystals.
The atomic radius is the distance from the atomic nucleus to the outmost stable electron orbital in a atom that is at equilibrium.
The covalent radius in chemistry corresponds to half of the distance between two identical atomic nuclei, bound by a covalent bond.
Watchglass
Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10cm, used in various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover Petri dishes or beakers, and are also suited to weighing small amounts of matter or drying them in an airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.
Dehydrator
A dehydrator is a piece of laboratory apparatus, often made of glass, and which serves to dry chemical matters; that is, to remove water or liquid from a sample. \t\t\tIn principle it is a glass bowl with cap that has a planar grinding, so that the bowl is air-tight. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent such as calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. The sample to be dried is placed on a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramic above the drying agent. \t\t\tThe drying agent is hygroscopic, which means that it dehumidifies its environment by absorbing water vapor. The dry atmosphere then takes up water from the sample to be dried.
Spatula
The spatula is a laboratory tool to scrape off, grind, and transport chemicals. The material they are made of (e. g. iron, titanium, platinum) and their design (e. g. flat spatula or spoon spatula) varies.
Water Jet Pump
The water jet pump has two entry pipes and one exit, and consists, in principle, of two pipes one inside the other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full pressure out of a nozzle into a slightly larger pipe. The water jet thereby carries away air or fluid from the second entry. This is caused by the negative pressure in a drifting fluid, and thus it is an application of the hydrodynamic paradox (objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away).
Refractometer
With a refractometer the refractive index of optical media is determined. If the refractive index of a chemical is known it can be used after a synthesis to determine the sample's purity or to audit the synthesis' success.
Mortar
A mortar is used for manually grinding solids. It can also be used to homogenize a mixture of powders by grinding. A club-shaped tool known as a pestle is used with the mortar for grinding.
Heating Coil
Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.
Cork Ring
Large containers like round-bottomed flasks are placed on rings made of cork, a special soft lightweight wood with good insulating qualities to protect fragile instruments.
Dropping Funnel
A dropping funnel can be used to drop precise amounts of fluid. The dropping speed can be controlled with a valve.
Separating Funnel
A separating funnel can be used to separate a mixture of fluids of differing densities. A valve at the bottom allows the denser fluid to be drained for transfer to another container.
Test Tube Rack
This rack is useful when many small amounts of chemicals are to be tested in a row; or alternatively, to dry test tubes.
Vortexer
A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM at which point a contact sensor is activated. In this way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.
Wash Bottle
These bottles are used for many purposes. In most laboratories they are usually filled with water, salt, acid or other commonly used fluids. They make it easy to apply the fluid if a precisely measured amount is not needed.
Rotary Evaporator
A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water, and is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. In this way solutions can be concentrated or purified. By attaching a vacuum pump, the air pressure and therefore the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.
Reflux Condenser
A reflux condenser subjects fluid to a process where a gas produced by heating is collected on the reflux condenser. The fluid is cooled until it condenses and runs back into the original fluid. Usually it is put on a round-bottomed flask or several neck flasks.
Pipette Bulb
A pipette bulb is used to fill pipettes. Squeezing then releasing the bulb produces a negative pressure, causing fluid to flow into the pipette; squeezing the bulb then causes the fluid to flow out of the pipette.
Test Tube
In a test tube small reactions or experiments are performed. There are many different types of tubes. For example some have connectors, some are etched for measurements, some are hardened for durability.
Protective Goggles
Most laboratories insist that protective goggles are worn. Without them, it is too risky to work with most chemicals. Usually, the lens is a special type of plastic that affords protection from both mechanical impacts, and acid and base chemicals.
Round-Bottomed Flask
A round-bottomed flask is used for many reactions. Some can be connected to other items, as the frosting on the neck shows. With cork rings they can be placed on a table.
Full Pipette
Unlike a regular pipette, a full pipette only has one marking for a specific volume.
Drying Tube
Some reactions need to be kept free of water: to make this possible a drying tube can be used. Drying tubes contains a hygroscopic chemical to absorb water from the atmosphere.
Test Tube Holder
Test tube holders make it easier to hold test tubes. By using a holder, there is a safe distance between ones hand and the test tube when the tube is hot. Typically, test tube holders are used to hold test tubes over open flames.
Measuring Cylinder
A measuring cylinder can be used to measure amounts of liquids relatively precisely. Furthermore, the cylinder allows particulate matter to sink: following this, the particulates can be separated from the fluid by decanting.
Thermometer
A thermometer can be used to determine the temperature of a sample. In a laboratory, special thermometers are used which can also be used within acids or bases.
Magnetic Stir Bar
Magnetic stir bars are highly chemically inert, small magnetic bars. Most heaters have a built-in magnet which can rotate: this causes the stir bar to rotate and the mixture to become homogenized.
Magnetic Stir Bar Retriever
A magnetic stir bar retriever can be used to retrieve magnetic stir bars from containers. The retriever is a bar with a magnet at the end which attracts the stir bars.
Pipette
Pipettes are used to introduce small quantities of liquids in laboratories. A pipette has a volume scale and, as a rule, pipette bulbs are used as droppers for liquids. Both sorts of pipettes are calibrated for fluids with a temperature of 20°C and for time of outflow (signified by "Ex."). If needed, times of outflow are indicated on the pipettes.
Erlenmeyer Flask
An Erlenmeyer flask, named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), is different to a beaker in that it comes with an inverted conical base and a cylindrical neck. There are different types of Erlenmeyer flasks for laboratory applications: the narrow neck and wide neck forms. Depending on the application the flask may have precision grinding to allow good connection to other containers. \t\t\t \t\t\tThe narrow neck reduces the risk of fluid escaping, especially when boiling or during reactions which agitate the contents. \t\t\t \t\t\tAn Erlenmeyer flask is useful for mixing fluids or accelerating reactions by stirring or shaking, for example. The Erlenmeyer flask is particularly suited for a magnetic stirrer, since it can be placed directly on the stirring platform. A round-bottomed flask, by contrast, must be placed on a cork ring on the stirring platform.
Ultrasonic Bath
For some chemical reactions it is important that the solvent is gas free. To achieve this the reaction vessel is put for some time into a ultrasonic bath. Due to the high sound frequency, the vapor locks peel away and ascend. This procedure is called out-gassing.
Scales
In a laboratory, very precise quantities of reagents often have to be weighed out. High precision scales can measure masses down to 1/ 10000 gram. As such, they stand on granite blocks to avoid vibrations and are protected against changes in airflow by a dome.
Distillation bridge
One means of separating a mixture is to use distillation. In this setting, a distillation bridge acts as a conduit between the two pots. One pot contains the mixture to be separated, and through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed and drips into a round flask. Typically, the bridge is cooled by return flow. Also, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature of the distillation bridge.
Syringe
A syringe consists of two parts, a glass tube and a plunger, both normally made of glass. Gasses flow into the glass tube, and as the syringe is a closed system, the plunger moves outwards. This can be used to measure the volume of a reaction.
Separation Beaker
First, four small caps are placed at the four ends of the separation beaker. Then, whilst distilling, the beaker is turned by 60 degrees after a certain temperate has been reached. In doing so, at the end of the distillation, all four caps contain a specific liquid, depending on the boiling point of the liquid distilled.
Burner
There are several types of burners; this picture shows a Teclu-Burner. Each type of burner has specific uses, and they vary in peak temperature and overall heating capacity.
Extractor Hood
Extractor hoods are used to filter out gasses from chemical reactions. The air, once cleaned, is pumped outside of the building.
Contact Thermometer
Clamps
Laboratory clamps make it easier to hold many kinds of tools.
Short-Stem Funnel
Buret
Burets are used to titrate liquids. A buret is filled with a specific volume of a liquid, and placed beneath it is a container such as an Erlenmeyer flask. By opening the valve on the buret, the liquid in the container will then be titrated. High-quality burets have a venting mechanism with which they can be very easily refilled with the exact volume for which the buret is calibrated.
Beaker
Beakers can be used for many tasks. For instance, they are used to store chemicals and to perform chemical reactions. They are often also used for titrations.
DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimeter)
A DSC measures the heat flow volume of a compound. This value is very specific for every kind of matter, and thus a DSC can be used to identify chemicals or to describe them.

The equation solver allows you to balance a chemical equation. Using VariablesTo express variable quantities of an element, put a single character in front of the element's symbol, as shown in this example: aH + bO - > 5H2O (Result: 10 H + 5 O -gt; 5 H2O)Solving this expression will give you the needed amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen. Defining electric chargesUse box brackets to specify the electric charge of an element, as shown in this example:4H[+] + 2O - > cH2O[2+] (Result: 4 H+ + 2 O -gt; 2 H2O2+)

Type accented & letters
If this is checked, you have to type accented letters yourself (i.e. they are differentiated from the corresponding unaccented letter).
If this is disabled, the selected language does not support it. If this is enabledand if you check it, then you should type accented letters on their own. If it is not checked, accented letters will be displayed with normal letters (default). For example, in Catalan, if this is unchecked and you type "o", the o and ò will be displayed in the word xenofòbia. If this option is checked, when you type "o", only "o" will be displayed and you will have to type "ò" for this letter to be displayed.
German
Play in upper case letters
If checked, the word will be displayed all in upper case letters
If this is checked, the word will be displayed in upper case letters, even if you enter them in lower case. If this is unchecked (default), the word will be in lower case. This setting is currently only available for the German language.
Here you can choose settings for all languages.
Check this if you do not want to discover each instance of the same letter.
If you check this box, only the first letter will be written if the letter is found in several places in the word. Then you have to rechoose the same letter, to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter. For example, the word to guess is "potato". If this option is unchecked, when you try "o", the two instances of "o" in the word will be discovered at the same time. If this is checked, you will need to try "o" twice. Default is that for one letter typed, all instances of that letter in the word are discovered.
Require more guesses for duplicate letters

If checked, sounds will be played for New Game and Win Game

You can control a kig construction by means of a "pykig" python script, that can be executed with the command pykig. py. Here is a nice example (hexagons. kpy) you can try: kigdocument. hideobjects() def hexagons (c, v, n): hexagon = PolygonBCV (c, v, 6) if n & lt; = 0: hexagon. show() for i in range(6): PolygonSide (hexagon, i, True) return cnew = MidPoints (c, v) hexagons (cnew, v, n-1) for k in [2,4]: v1 = PolygonVertex (hexagon, k) cnew = MidPoints (c, v1) hexagons (cnew, v1, n-1) hexagons (Point(0,0), Point(1,0), 5)
You can repeat the latest construction simply by pressing the key'Z '; this comes in very handy if you need to construct a sequence of objects with the same construction, especially if there is no shortcut for that construction.
One of the most powerful tools in Kig are the menus that you can enter by right-clicking on an object, or on some empty space in the document. You can use them to give objects names, change their colors and line styles, and lots of other interesting things.
You can construct new points without using the menu or the toolbar, simply clicking somewhere on the Kig document with the middle mouse button.
Kig can open several file formats: its files (. kig files), KGeo files, KSeg files, and, partially, Dr. Geo and Cabri#8482; files.
Kig has more than 20 objects and 10 transformations with more than 80 constructions you can use in your documents: open the Objects menu to see them all.
You can use the selected objects to start the construction of an object which requires the selected objects as arguments. For example, if you have two points selected, you can choose Start- > Circle by Three Points from the popup menu to start constructing a circle by three points.
Kig can extends its object set using external macros. You can find some interesting macros on the Kig website: http: / /edu. kde. org/ kig.
If you have more than one object under the mouse, and you want to select any of them, you can click with the left mouse button, while holding the Shift key, to get a list of the objects under the mouse cursor which you can then select from.
When you construct a locus, you can click on it with the right mouse button and select cartesian equation to see its cartesian equation, whenever it is an algebraic curve of low degree.

Toggle Tracking on/ off
If checked, the sky will remain focused on its current position or object as time passes. This is called "Tracking". Note that tracking is automatically engaged whenever an object is centered at the focus point. So, if you use "lookToward" with an object name, you do not need to engage tracking. If unchecked, then Tracking will be forced off, even if an object has been centered. As time passes, the sky will then appear to drift by (due to the rotation of the Earth).

Welcome to the Observing List Wizard With this tool, you can construct an observing list by filtering the list of all objects in various ways. First, you will select objects by type. Next, you can select only those objects which occupy a specific region on the sky. You can further trim the observing list by selecting objects in a specified magnitude range. Finally, you can choose to keep only those objects which are observable on a particular date. Press the Next button to get started by selecting which object types you would like to be present in your observing list.
Select objects by type Highlight the object types you want to include in your observing list in the box below. You can highlight more than one item in the list. The buttons along the right can be used to quickly choose some common selections. When you are finished, press the Next button.

Telescope Wizard
Welcome to the KStars Telescope Setup Wizard! This Wizard will help you to connect to your telescope and control it from KStars. You will be asked to verify some basic information. You can get extended information on telescope support in KStars by pressing the help button at any point during the Wizard. Please click next to continue.
1. Telescope Model Please select your telescope model from the list below. Click next after selecting a model.
Tip Some non-Meade telescopes support a subset of the LX200 command set. Select LX200 Basic to control such devices.
2. Align Your Telescope You need to align your telescope before you can control it properly from KStars. Please refer to your telescope manual for alignment instructions. After a successful alignment, connect your telescope's RS232 interface to your computer's serial or USB port. Click next to continue.
3. Verify Local Settings Verify if the following time, date, and location settings are correct. If any of the settings are incorrect, you can correct them via the Set time and Set Location buttons.

4. Determine Connection Port Enter the port number your telescope is connected to. If you only have one serial port in your computer, the port is usually / dev/ ttyS0 If you are unsure about the port number, you can leave the field empty and KStars will try to scan the ports for attached telescopes. Beware that the autoscan process might take a few minutes to complete.

\t\t You can locate objects in the sky by their name. \t\t\tUse Ctrl+F, the "Pointing- > Find Object" menu item, or the "Find Object" \t\t\tToolbar button. \t\t \t
\t\t To change your Geographic Location, \t\t\tuse Ctrl+G, the "Settings- > Geographic..." menu item, \t\t\tor the "globe" Toolbar button. \t\t \t
\t\t You can Track an object, so it will always be centered \t\t\tin the display. \t\t\tUse Ctrl+T, the "Pointing- > Engage Tracking" menu item, or the "lock" \t\t\tToolbar button. You can also simply center the object by \t\t\tdouble-clicking on it or selecting "Center and Track" from the \t\t\tobject's popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t The KStars Handbook includes the AstroInfo Project, a series \t\t\tof informative articles about Astronomy. \t\t \t
\t\t There are three on-screen "Info Boxes" which show data related to the \t\t\ttime/ date, your geographic location, and the current central position on the \t\t\tsky (the focus). You can drag these boxes with the mouse, and "shade" them \t\t\tby double-clicking them to show more (or less) information. You can hide \t\t\tthem altogether in the Settings- > Info Boxes menu. \t\t \t
\t\t KStars has a full-screen mode; you can toggle this mode using the \t\t\t"fullscreen "toolbar button, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F. \t\t \t
\t\t The N, S, E, W keys will point the display at the North, \t\t\tSouth, East and West points on the Horizon. The Z key will point the \t\t\tdisplay at the Zenith. \t\t \t
\t\t The 0-9 keys will center the display on one of the major solar system \t\t\tbodies. 0 centers on the Sun, 3 centers on the Moon; the rest are the eight \t\t\tplanets, in order of their distance from the Sun. \t\t \t
\t\t Click and Drag with the mouse to slew the skymap to a new position on \t\t\tthe sky. \t\t \t
\t\t Double-click with the mouse to center the display on the location \t\t\tof the mouse cursor. If you double-click on an object, KStars will \t\t\tautomatically begin tracking it. \t\t \t
\t\t The status bar displays the current sky coordinates of the mouse cursor, \t\t\tin both Equatorial and Horizontal coordinate systems. \t\t \t
\t\t The display can be zoomed in or out by spinning your mouse's scroll wheel, \t\t\tor by dragging the mouse up or down with the middle mouse button pressed. You \t\t\tcan also use the +/ - keys, or the "Zoom In"/" Zoom Out "items in the toolbar and \t\t\tin the View menu. The Zoom Level can be set manually using the" Zoom to Angular \t\t\tSize "item in the View menu (Shift+Ctrl+Z), and you can set it graphically by \t\t\tholding down the Ctrl button while dragging the mouse to define a rectangle for \t\t\tthe new window boundaries. \t\t \t
\t\t You can manually set the coordinates of the central Focus point. \t\t\tPress Ctrl+M, or use the "Pointing- > Set Focus Manually..." menu item, and enter \t\t\tthe desired coordinates in the popup window. \t\t \t
\t\t To switch between Equatorial and Horizontal coordinate \t\t\tsystems, use the "View- > Coordinates" menu item, or press the spacebar. \t\t \t
\t\t To set the Time and Date, type Ctrl+S, use the "Time- > Set Time" menu item, \t\t\tor press the "time" toolbar button. Note that dates in KStars can be very \t\t\tremote; you can use any year between -50,000 and +50,000. \t\t \t
\t\t You can use Ctrl+E or the "Time- > Set Time to Now" menu item to synchronize \t\t\tthe simulation clock with your CPU clock. \t\t \t
\t\t The Spin Box in the Toolbar allows you to adjust the time step \t\t\tused by the KStars clock; setting it to "1.0 sec" provides "real time". \t\t\tNote: negative values make time run backwards. \t\t \t
\t\t You can stop and start the clock with the "Play/ Pause" button \t\t\tin the Toolbar, or with the "Time- > Stop Clock" menu item. \t\t \t
\t\t You can advance the simulation clock forward or backward by a single \t\t\ttime step by pressing the "gt;" or "lt;" keys. \t\t \t
\t\t When you click your mouse in the map, the object in the sky nearest \t\t\tthe mouse cursor is identified in the status bar. \t\t \t
\t\t When you hold the mouse cursor still for a moment, the nearest object \t\t\twill be identified by a temporary name label that automatically fades \t\t\tout when you move the mouse again. \t\t \t
\t\t Right-click with the mouse to open a popup menu of detailed options \t\t\tfor a particular object, including links to images and information on \t\t\tthe Internet. \t\t \t
\t\t The deep-sky objects with a special color (the default is Red) \t\t\thave extra URL links available in their popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t By default, stars in KStars are displayed with realistic colors. \t\t\tA star's color depends on its temperature; cooler stars are red, \t\t\twhile hotter stars are blue. \t\t \t
\t\t If you want the very latest orbital information for asteroids and \t\t\tcomets (including recently-discovered objects), check the "Download \t\t\tData" tool ("File- > Download New Data" or Ctrl+D) frequently for updated \t\t\tephemerides. \t\t \t
\t\t The Details window provides a large amount of information on any \t\t\tobject in the sky, including coordinates, rise/ set times, Internet \t\t\tlinks, and your own custom notes. Access the Details window through \t\t\tthe popup menu, or by clicking on an object and then pressing "D". \t\t \t
\t\t You can attach a name label to any object in the sky. Toggle the \t\t\tlabel in the popup menu, or by clicking on the object and then \t\t\tpressing "L". \t\t \t
\t\t The KStars Astrocalculator (Ctrl+C) gives you direct access to many \t\t\tof the calculations that KStars does behind-the-scenes. \t\t \t
\t\t The AAVSO Light Curve Generator tool (Ctrl+V) connects to a server at the \t\t\tAmerican Association of Variable Star Observers, and constructs a \t\t\tlightcurve for any of the 6000+ variable stars that they monitor \t\t\ton a daily basis. \t\t \t
\t\t The Altitude vs. Time tool (Ctrl+A) will plot altitude curves for any group \t\t\tof objects that you select. This is a great tool for planning \t\t\tobserving sessions. \t\t \t
\t\t With the What's Up Tonight? tool (Ctrl+U), you can tell at a glance what \t\t\tobjects will be visible from your location on a given night. \t\t \t
\t\t The Observing List tool (Ctrl+L) gives you easy access to a selected group \t\t\tof objects. Add objects to the list through the popup menu, or by \t\t\tclicking on the object, and pressing "O". \t\t \t
\t\t The ScriptBuilder tool allows you to construct complex D-Bus \t\t\tscripts using a simple GUI. The scripts can be played back later \t\t\tfrom the command line, or from within KStars. \t\t \t
\t\t The Solar System Viewer tool (Ctrl+Y) shows an overhead view of the solar \t\t\tsystem, showing the positions of the major planets for the current \t\t\tsimulation date. \t\t \t
\t\t The Jupiter Moons tool (Ctrl+J) shows the relative positions of Jupiter's \t\t\tfour largest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto), as seen from \t\t\tEarth, and as a function of time. \t\t \t
\t\t You can export the sky image to a file using the "Save Sky Image" \t\t\titem in the File menu, or by pressing Ctrl+I. In addition, you can \t\t\trun KStars from a command prompt with the "--dump" argument to save a \t\t\tsky image to disk without even opening the program window. This can \t\t\tbe used to generate dynamic wallpaper for your KDE desktop. \t\t \t
\t\t To add your own custom Object Catalogs, select "Import Catalog" or \t\t\t"Load Catalog "from the Catalogs tab in the KStars Configuration window. \t\t\tSee the Handbook for instructions on formatting your catalog file. \t\t \t
\t\t To add your own custom image/ information URLs to \t\t\tany object, select "Add Link..." from the object's popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can adjust dozens of display options by clicking the \t\t\t"configure "Toolbar button, or selecting the" Settings- > Configure KStars... "\t\t\tmenu item. \t\t \t
\t\t The on-screen Info Boxes can be hidden or shown using the \t\t\t"Settings- > Info Boxes "menu. \t\t \t
\t\t The Toolbars can be hidden or shown using the "Settings- > Toolbars" menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can hide either the Ra/ Dec or Az/ Alt coordinate fields in the statusbar, \t\t\tor hide the statusbar completely, using the Settings- > Statusbar menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can easily switch between predefined color schemes by selecting \t\t\tthe scheme from the "Settings- > Color Schemes" menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can define your own Geographic Locations. Fill in the \t\t\trequired fields in the "Set Geographic Location" Dialog and then press the \t\t\t"Add City to List "button. Your Locations will be available in all \t\t\tfuture sessions. \t\t \t
\t\t You can define your own Color Schemes. Adjust the colors \t\t\tin the Configuration Window's "Colors" Tab, and then press the "Save \t\t\tCurrent Colors" button. Your Color Scheme will appear in the list in \t\t\tall future sessions. \t\t \t
\t\t You can construct your own field-of-view (FOV) symbols, using the \t\t\tFOV Editor from the Settings- > FOV Symbols menu. You can set the angular size, the \t\t\tshape, and the color of your new symbols. \t\t \t
\t\t The Advanced tab of the KStars Configuration window allows you to fine-tune \t\t\tthe behavior of KStars. You can specify whether to correct for atmospheric \t\t\trefraction, and whether to use animated slewing. You can also specify which \t\t\tobjects are hidden while the display is in motion. \t\t \t
\t\t KStars displays 126,000 stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects, 88 constellations, \t\t\tall planets, the Sun, the Moon, thousands of comets and asteroids, and the \t\t\tMilky Way. \t\t \t
\t\t The line in the sky that the Sun and all the Planets seem to follow \t\t\tis called the Ecliptic. \t\t \t
\t\t Object positions in KStars include the effects of precession, nutation, \t\t\taberration, atmospheric refraction, and light travel time (for planets). \t\t \t
\t\t The nearest star to the Sun is Rigel Kentaurus (alpha Centauri). \t\t\tThe brightest star in the sky is Sirius (alpha Canis Majoris). \t\t \t
\t\t The large group of galaxies between Leo, Virgo and Coma Berenices \t\t\tis called the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies. \t\t \t
\t\t The large group of clusters and nebulae near the south celestial pole \t\t\tare objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a dwarf galaxy in \t\t\torbit around the Milky Way. \t\t \t
\t\t The Messier Catalog is a list of 110 of the brightest non-stellar objects \t\t\tin the sky. It includes such famous objects as the Orion Nebula (M 42), the \t\t\tAndromeda Galaxy (M 31), and the Pleiades (M 45). \t\t \t

Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.
The default Killbots game type. Includes a medium size grid, safe teleports, fast enemies and pushable junkheaps.
Easy
An easier version of the "Killbots" game type. Includes a bigger game grid prepopulated with junkheaps, a starting stash of energy and an increasing energy cap.
Energy Crisis
The player starts with 30 energy and cannot earn more. How many rounds can you survive and how many points can you collect before your energy and luck run out?

Welcome!
This tutorial will teach you how to play KBlackBox, using a simple example. We are playing with a square black box of 6 columns and 6 rows. It has 3 balls hidden inside it and 24 laser probes around it. The goal is to find the positions of the balls.
Click on "Next"
Black box principles
The balls are not visible, but we can shoot laser beams into the box at different entry points and observe if the laser beams leave the box, and if they do, where they come out. The laser beams interact with the balls in various ways.
Please click on the marked laser to shoot a beam into the black box.
No interaction
If a laser beam does not interact with any ball in the black box, it comes out at the point opposite the entry point. Example: Suppose we have 3 balls in the box as shown. They will not affect laser beam "1". As the game progresses, each pair of entry/ exit points is marked with a different number.
Now shoot the marked laser to discover the first kind of interaction.
Hit
A direct impact on a ball is called a "hit". A beam that hits a ball does not emerge from the black box. Example: The beam might have hit a ball at the position shown, but the exact position of the hit is not certain: There are many other possibilities.
Shoot the marked laser to discover the second kind of interaction.
Simple deflection
The interaction of a beam that does not actually hit a ball, but aims to one side of it, is called a "deflection". The angle of deflection of the beam is always 90 degrees. Example: The ball shown would deflect beam "2" upward, as shown, but this is not the only possibility.
Click on "Next" to see another combination of ball positions that deflects the laser beam as shown.
Several deflections
As you can see, interactions in the black box can be quite complicated! A laser beam entering and exiting at the positions "2" might have been deflected by this configuration of 3 balls.
Shoot the marked laser to discover another kind of result.
Reflection
If the laser beam leaves the black box at the entry point, it has been reflected backward inside the black box. Example: We have placed 2 balls for you in a configuration that would lead to such a reflection.
Shoot the marked laser to see another backward reflection case.
Special reflection
If a ball is at the edge of the box (with no other ball nearby), a beam which is aimed into the black box directly beside it causes a backward reflection. Example: The configuration shown can cause a backward reflection.
Nearly done. Click on "Next".
Marker for "free position"
We are sure there are no balls in the first 2 columns. If there were any, the beam entering at position "1" would hit a ball or be deflected by a ball in column 2. You can mark a "free position" with a right mouse click (see also keyboard shortcuts). Example: There are 12 markers in the first 2 columns.
Click on "Next".
Marking balls
When you have worked out where a ball is, please use the left mouse button to mark it. To remove a ball mark, use the left mouse button again. Last tip: If you are not sure about a position, you can use a right click on a ball to mark it as "unsure". (See also keyboard shortcuts.) Example: We marked one position as sure, the other one as unsure.
Let us play!
Congratulations! You now know all the rules for KBlackBox. You can start to play. Try to finish this tutorial game by yourself! Tip: We have sent in enough beams to deduce the positions of the 3 balls with certainty. Of course, you can use some more shots if needed.
Finish placing the balls and click on "Done!" when you are done!

The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.

Impossible?
No, it is not impossible. There is a trick in how you dig the bricks next to the gold nuggets.
Go up the left side to the top and across. Drop down left of the bricks. There is more than one route from these bars to the gold. When starting, wait on a short ladder while the enemy above falls past you on the left.
Short Cut?
Yes, you just have time to zip across the bottom, dodging all the enemies to get to the gold.
Sky Walker
To get the gold in the cave, dig two bricks, wait till they start to re-appear, then quickly dig the third brick (your escape route). Run back up, dig and drop onto the gold. You can JUST get past the fourth enemy if you wait on the bottom ladder as he falls to the floor next to you. Finally, take a wandering route through the sky and emerge at the top left.
The Vault
You can trap enemies in the bottom vault by waiting at the bottom of the long ladder. To kill them, come out, dig one brick, then go back and wait again.
Patchwork Quilt
To get the gold in the top middle section, dig three bricks next to the trapped enemy, wait till they start to re-appear, dig once more, then run up and right to fall back to where the enemy was. Now you can dig and get onto the ladders before he gets back to you.
Do You Need Him?
You can leave the enemy where he is. Go nearly to the gold at the bottom right. Do not pick it up yet, but go up and get the two nuggets at the top left. Then you can come back down to where you were and complete the level.
Stuck in Storage
First clean out the cave by digging three bricks at the right. Later you can kill enemies on the bottom bricks and trap them in the cave. At the right, get the vertical row of gold first, then go across and get the gold on the horizontal platforms. Stay right, dig through the last platform, then dig and get the right hand nugget in the cave. Finally pick up the left hand nugget.
So Far for So Little
At the start, go down and dig. At the finish, approach the gold from below.
Finish by collecting the two nuggets either side of a ladder on the left, then the four at the very bottom of the tomb. You need to get an enemy to fall onto the hanging nugget in the left side of the pyramid. You need another to fill the pit at bottom left. The rest is several digging puzzles, often with limited time to get out before your escape route closes. Enjoy!
Entangled
Drop from the bar at top left and you will get to the gold. Exit right and up, on the ladders that appear. Go across the top until you are seven or eight spaces from the right, then go down. As you head diagonally down to the left, there are two false bricks. Drop into the second one, stay inside it and dig right. Now fall into a string of ladders that leads down and to the left...
Flying Tower
Well you just have to be fast and accurate on this one and that is all we can say...
Pot Hole
Well, the old MG was pretty fast and agile in its day and you have to be too. You can try digging three bricks left and one centre to kill one of the enemies right at the start, but chances are he will fall into the pot hole on the right and you will have no chance of collecting the last lot of gold.
Sticky Ladders
Start by going about three quarters the way up the ladder. The enemies run right. Run to the top in time to get one to fall through a false brick while the others run towards you. Go left, dig two holes to trap them, then run right, dig and fall to the bottom of the first small ladder on the right. The enemies should come down the long ladder and fill up the two false bricks at its foot. Dig and catch the third enemy on top of the thick brick area, then run to the second space from the bottom of the long ladder, next to a row of bricks. The enemy should run into the pits on the left.
The Laboratory
You have to go up the leftmost ladder to get to every nugget and then exit to the next level. Come across from the right to collect the top centre nugget. Get past enemies on the'bunsen burner 'by killing them on the right of it, by dropping through the middle of it when they are nearly touching you and will fall after you OR by jumping left over their heads before they get to the top of the burner.
Pete likes Ladders
Keep going between the top and bottom to dodge the enemy. Pick up nuggets when you can. If the enemy gets one he can only drop it in one of the empty spaces. So keep him running through them and wait patiently...
Where is the Roof?
First clear up all the gold at the left and top, then dig out the cave and collect the gold on the ladders between the two low walls of false brick. If there is an enemy in that section, kill him by hiding in the bottom of a false wall and digging one hole next to it. He will die as he attempts to get you. This will not work if there is gold on the brick you want to dig...
Ninja Style
After collecting all the gold on the left, stay over there, go up high, get the enemy to follow you, then drop to the floor. If an enemy falls near the middle ladder on the right, quickly climb to a point higher than that ladder. After a few tries, you should get all three enemies at the right onto the long rightmost ladder. Now it is easy to clear out the first two areas of gold on the right. Attract three or maybe only two enemies onto the middle ladder at the right. Go up near the hole in the concrete, drop, run right, go up the long ladder, drop left and collect the gold. If you get only two enemies onto the middle ladder, make sure the third one is dropping off the right ladder before you run across. You will then have to go all the way up the long ladder and wait till it is safe to drop left and collect the gold. If the enemies are still carrying gold, keep them chasing you around on the middle ladder and falling to the concrete until they release it.
Cooperation?
It looks as though you should trap two enemies in the two pits at the bottom. Try it, but it is very hard to get one into the right hand pit and you are apt to get an enemy with gold in the left hand pit. Four false bricks further left prevent you running over from the left and digging. It is best to pick up the bottom row of gold last, dropping in via the hanging nugget at the right and escaping via the ladder that appears. The key to clearing up the left hand section is the line of ladders embedded in the bricks. Exit via the three places that have false bricks beneath them. It is suicide to drop onto the middle of the T-shaped bricks. Start by collecting the gold on the right of the T: then you can get an enemy to run into the U-shaped pit. Watch out for the false brick in the middle of the platform at the lower left. You have to collect the gold in separate trips from the left and the right.
Triple Trap
Trap the first enemy immediately. Go up and right and hang on the ladder to the right of a short bar. As the enemy arrives, climb up quickly. As he reaches you again, go left, drop and go up the left hand ladder to the top. The enemy should head right, over the concrete, and fall. Now go down to the bottom left corner. The enemy should drop into a false brick next to the gold. Collect all gold at the top, then dig and drop to the next enemy. Stand on him, dig left and move right. The enemy will drop into the pit. Move to the right and collect more gold as you fall. Climb to the top, drop onto the trapped enemy via a false brick under a bar and collect five more nuggets. Now dig and go down the short ladder at the right of the bricks, to kill the enemy in the pit (who has more gold). He should reappear above you and fall through a false brick back into the pit. Dig three bricks between the two enemies and go down the short ladder until the enemies bunch up. Dig two more bricks to release them. Go up the ladder, over the concrete and, just before the enemies get up to the concrete, drop down to the floor and run to the bottom of the short ladder. The enemies should come down and run into the double pit on the right. Quickly run out to the right, over the enemies. Drop onto the last piece of gold, over on the right and the hidden ladders appear. Phew! P. S. Another way to trap the left hand enemy in the false brick is to get him to follow you up the leftmost ladder while you run across the top and dig to drop onto the second enemy. Timing is VERY tight. You must dig and drop before the enemy climbs over the top left and runs right. Later, climb the right hand ladders to the top, wait on the left hand bar over a false brick till the leftmost enemy starts to run towards you, then drop. Wait again till he starts to drop, then dig two bricks at the right of a short ladder, go right and drop, then run left to the bottom of a short ladder. The enemy should drop through a false brick and a ladder into the false brick beneath. P. P. S. There is no room for error or hesitation in this method! Not much in the first method either!
State Of Terror
Just when you thought it was safe... fifteen levels of pure terror, using those quirky-yet-fast KGoldrunner rules. Composed by Stuart Popejoy - spopejoy@panix. com
Easy Gold
Proceed downward from platform to platform to the third from lowest. Wait at the rightmost point to get the enemies to fall to the bottom. Fall onto the lowest platform, dig above the gold and then dig right, while falling, and escape back to the top of the platform. Head upward as quickly as you can.
Fear of Heights
For each side of the terrace structure, run up the outside ladder from the bottom and fall onto the lowest platform. Run up the center ladder and wait at a gap for enemies from the outside ladders to fall. Fall after them to get to the gold. After collecting the gold, run right, across the top with enemies in tow, and fall to the right of the outside ladder. As the enemies fall after you, run back up the ladder and fall on top of the enemies to get to the pole.
The Spiral
Work your way out of the spiral, digging to trap enemies just before you emerge from the tunnels. Proceed up to the top left. As you run right, drop into the zig-zag area before the enemy does, so as to get to the top side at the right. After collecting the gold, dig to trap enemies at the bottom, then exit at the top left.
Crags of Fire
Generally, dig down and go through to get the gold, then move right and up to the next crag. The top-mid crag, however, needs to be done before the second-from-left crag. Leave one piece of gold in the middle area for last. Then get out quick!
The Heist
The safest way to enter the building is to go down the top-left ladder and wait on top of the short ladder to the right. As an enemy approaches, run over him to the pole. Now go right and fall onto the balcony, then dig out and fall. Run into the lobby and up the ladder sculpture to get gold. Fall off to the left onto the concrete block and wait for the enemies to bunch up. Fall left and run back outside to the concrete outcropping with the enemies following. Use the same ladder and pole to get back in. Run to the very top of the building up the rightmost ladders. Stand at the leftmost point of the roof. Wait for an enemy to fall below you, then step back, dig and fall after him to the balcony, where you can collect three gold pieces. If you wait long enough on the roof before falling you can persuade several enemies to follow and become trapped on the balcony. Use the ladders on the right to collect the remaining gold and exit.
Endless Enemies (1)
Collect the gold by working from top to bottom. Before the last gold, dig to the right of it and left of the enemy. Run up as fast as you can.
Torture Chamber
Fall off the ledge, digging left to go left up the ladder. Continue left from the pole, then fall while digging left and collect some gold. Go right, fall through the false brick below the ladder, continue right and fall through a brick tunnel to the pole below. Head right and fall through another brick tunnel while digging right. Dig and trap the enemy, next to the ladder, run up and left then dig and fall to collect the gold. Dig to trap the enemy again. When the first hole fills, run up to the top of the section with the enemy following. Dig at the left to collect gold and fall back onto the pole. Now head left and fall through a brick tunnel, digging left to trap the next enemy. Go to the upper left of the section, then fall and dig left and jump left to reach the platform at the bottom left. You can now navigate the spiral of ladders and brick tunnels to pick up four more gold pieces. After that, go back out to the right, fall and walk over the enemy trapped at the bottom, to return to the right hand half of the play area. Head up the ladders to the upper right, then fall, digging right twice, to gather the last piece of gold. Repeat falling in the brick tunnel to the right and digging right to trap the enemy. Finally, escape via the right hand side of the play area.
Endless Cascade
Infiltration
Run fast and dig well... At the innermost chamber, stand on the leftmost or rightmost brick on top and dig the next brick in towards the center. Fall onto the enemy and run right or left, then dig to trap him. You will have to be quick!
Endless Enemies (2)
Go left and fall on the gold, then go right to collect the next two pieces. Wait, high up on a pole at the far right of the play area, for the enemies to collect at the bottom right. Now go left and down and fall on the leftmost, bottom gold. Ignore the last gold for now, but go right and up along three poles and up three ladders. Step left off the third ladder while digging left, to prepare a trap for the enemy in the box on the left. Quickly go back down, fall on the last gold and prepare to move up and left in a hurry as a short hidden ladder appears below and to your left. The enemies swarm after you, but keep going till you get back to where you set the trap. The enemy should be in it now. Continue up and left over a short ladder, then down and left over long poles and ladders to the next short ladder. Go up and left again, then up and right over more long ladders and poles to the top of the screen.
Tunnels (1) - The Monster
The monster is made almost completely of false bricks. Analyze the concrete parts of his body, to determine where to fall and where not to fall. All four enemies will have to be trapped above particular concrete pieces, to enable you to reach certain gold pieces. Trap the enemies by using KGoldrunner rules to your advantage. Wait on the top pole at the point where you want the enemy to fall. As he approaches you, fall onto a lower pole and move left or right to avoid the enemy's fate. This is how he falls into danger while you fall to safety.
Breaking and Entering
Break into the bottom left room, then proceed to the top right. Head left, grab the gold and escape by digging down to the middle floor. Continue all the way down to the bottom right. Before collecting the second gold piece, hang from the top pole in the center room of the bottom floor and dig one brick from the two-brick wall at the right. Run left over the enemies' heads, grab the gold and escape back through the dug brick. Run up to the top right room, then to the lower left area via the center. Dodge the enemies any way you can and climb up to the top left room. To get out of the building, dig rapidly while falling next to the left wall.
Tunnels (2) - The Honeycomb
Go to the top of the central ladder and work on the left side first. Fall onto ledge with gold. Outwit enemy to run through fake brick below ladder. While falling, dig left; run up ladder to gap and wait for enemy to fall in, escape, and fall in again to your dug brick; run up and left on pole, fall onto ledge while digging left, fall left, get gold, go right and fall into chamber while enemy spawns; get gold. You can dig into bottom chamber if you wish here. The other chambers are all accessible by dropping through fake brick tunnels. Dodge the enemies or fall on them to get the gold. To reach the right hand side, fall down the fake brick tunnel next to the central ladder and run fast to the right, digging behind you to trap the enemies. Collect the gold by going to the top and dropping through fake brick tunnels to the right of each piece.
Four Chambers Suspended
First Chamber. Dig down to collect the top left piece of gold. Fall onto the enemies to get the gold on the right. Dodge them to pick up the rest. Trap the enemies high on the right while you dig out through the bottom of the chamber. As you emerge, you must drop straight onto the ladder next to the concrete. Climb down that ladder, under the concrete to the right and then up to the top of the next chamber. Second Chamber. Proceed left to right with the shafts, using your digging skills to get the gold. On the rightmost shaft, dig left while falling, then fall left while digging both left and right. In the three-brick platform now remaining, dig the left brick, then the right and the center while falling right. Pick up the gold on the right and fall onto the last gold piece while digging left. Dig left again, fall onto the ladder next to the concrete, as before, and go on up to the next chamber. Third Chamber. Dig right, fall on the left gold piece and immediately dig right to trap the enemy, then dig and exit left. Repeat, one brick over, for the gold piece on the right. Now go back to the top and fall into the lower section, on top of the enemy. Take the short pole left and step across the falling enemy to grab the long pole going left. Fall on the gold, dig to trap the enemy, dig again and exit left. Repeat for the other hanging gold piece. This time dig down and out, onto the ladder next to the concrete, and so to the last chamber. Fourth Chamber. Trap the enemy, run to the top, dig through to the concrete on the left, wait for the enemy and fall on him to get at more gold on the left. When all the gold in this chamber is gone, run to the bottom and fall through to the floor. Now pick up the rest of the gold and get out quick.
Ruins
Fall on the enemy, dig below the gap on the right, then quickly go right, over his head. Pick up the gold, fall through a false brick, run up the ladder to the right and go to the right along the lower pole. Dig to the right (which traps the second enemy), get the gold, fall, dig left, fall, collect two gold pieces and go up two ladders. Move to the left via a false brick - the second enemy should still be trapped below. Go left to the ladder, down, then left and down through a false brick. Collect one gold, dig on the right, get three gold, dig and go up all the ladders on the right. Go left on the pole again, but this time climb upwards. Get one gold and dig right to trap another enemy. Move up to the top, go right, fall and continue to the concrete area at top center. Outwit the enemy in the concrete area, then exit by falling on him and moving to the gap on the left and down through two false bricks. Hold onto the pole at center screen, go right and back on up to the top. Move left on the pole and wait for the other enemy to enter the concrete area. Pick up the top gold, fall and exit left again, leaving two enemies trapped in the concrete. Go back up to the top again, but this time continue left towards the top-left corner of the screen. When you get up there, dig, fall through onto some gold and dig left twice while falling further. Now fall down the leftmost shaft and dig the brick that blocks the shaft. Wait for the enemy below to step into the shaft, then fall on him in order to collect the gold encased in concrete. Drop onto the remaining gold and fall to the bottom-left corner. Run right and up, right again, fall on three gold pieces and move on to the mid-bottom section. Outwit the enemy, go to the topmost ladder on the right, dig twice and fall through one gold and three bricks while digging right. Exit right to get more gold, then climb the ladder, dig and fall to collect another two gold pieces. Climb the ladder again, take the pole left, go up and then right to claim four gold pieces. Dig at the right-hand end and fall through three false bricks. Fall into the chamber, going right and digging left. Dig on the lower left to get out, then go back up to the pole and fall to onto the gold in this chamber. Exit right this time, collect some gold and climb up, up, up. Outwit the enemies in the upper-right area. It is possible to lure them into the chamber below by running ahead of them up the ladders. Collect the rightmost mid-level gold second to last and the gold at the bottom right last of all. Get out quick!
Advanced Tutorial
This tutorial is preparation for some of the things you might find in the middle levels of the'Initiation 'game. Enjoy...
Bars and Ladders
There is nowhere to dig, so you must dodge the enemies and avoid falling to the concrete at the wrong time. Try to keep the enemies together. If an enemy has gold coloring, he is holding a nugget. He might drop it as he runs over the concrete or maybe at the top of a ladder... patience, patience!
To kill...
You cannot get up to the gold, so you must get the enemies to bring it down to you. But how do you get them to keep going back? If you are feeling stressed, you can hit the Pause key (default P or Esc) and take a break. Also, you can use the Settings menu to slow down the action.
... Or not to kill?
It is best not to kill the enemy. Try it and you will find out why... Heh, heh, heh! If you do kill him unintentionally, before you have collected the gold at the top left, you can still finish the level by digging away the side of the pit he is in.
Traps
Some of the bricks here are not what they seem. They are known as false bricks, fall-through bricks or traps. If you try to walk on them, you fall through. If the enemies walk on them, they can descend on you without warning. Sometimes you have to fall through a brick to get some gold. At the start, jump into the concrete pit, dig and drop through. That will get one enemy tied up for a while...
Bye...
This is just a nice easy level to finish up with. Have fun with the other games in KGoldrunner. Note that there is a game Editor in which you and your friends can make up levels and challenge each other. And if you like action, the KGoldrunner rules used in some of the games are fast and furious. There is also a KGoldrunner Handbook in the Help Menu, which contains more detail than this Tutorial. It has been a pleasure showing you around. Bye!
Tutorial
This tutorial is a collection of easy levels that teaches you the rules of KGoldrunner and helps you develop the skills you need to get started. It uses the Traditional set of rules, similar to those used on early home-computers. Each level has a brief explanation, then you play... When you move on to play more advanced levels, you will find that KGoldrunner combines action, strategy and puzzle solving --- all in one game.
Hi!
Hi! Welcome to KGoldrunner! The idea of the game is to pick up all the gold nuggets, then climb to the top of the playing area and move up to the next level. A hidden ladder will appear as you collect the last nugget. The hero, at the top left, is your deputy. To collect the nuggets, just point the mouse where you want him to go. At first gravity takes over and he falls...
Navigation
This is an exercise in moving around. Follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right. The hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths (like _ _BAR_ L or U), so be careful not to get too far ahead of him. DANGER: Try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right. If you do get trapped there, the only way out is to kill the hero (press key Q for quit) and start the level again.
Digging
Now you have to dig to get the gold! Just use the left and right mouse buttons to dig left or right of the hero's position. The hero can then jump into and through the hole he has dug. He can also dig several holes in a row and run sideways through the dug holes. Be careful though. After a while the holes close up and you can get trapped and killed. In the third box down, you have to dig two holes, jump in and quickly dig one more, to get through two layers. On the right, you have to dig three, then two then one to get through. There are also two little puzzles to work out along the way. Good luck! By the way, you can dig through brick, but not concrete.
You Have ENEMIES!
Well, it has been nice and easy up to now, but the game would be no fun without enemies. They are after the gold too: worse still they are after you! You die if they catch you, but maybe you will have a few lives left and can start again. You can handle enemies by running away, digging a hole or luring them into part of the playing area where they get stranded. If an enemy falls into a hole, he gives up any gold he is carrying, then gets stuck in the hole for a time and climbs out. If the hole closes while he is in it, he dies and reappears somewhere else on the screen. You can deliberately kill enemies by digging several holes in a row. More importantly, you can run over an enemy's head. You should do that right at the start of this level. Dig a hole, trap the enemy, wait for him to fall all the way in, then run over him, with the other enemy in hot pursuit... If you are feeling stressed, you can hit the Pause key at any time (default P or Esc) and take a break. Hit it again when you wish to continue.
Bars
You can move horizontally along bars (or poles), but if you move down you will let go and fall... Also, note that you can collect gold by falling onto it.
False Bricks
Some of the bricks in this level are not what they seem. If you walk onto them you fall through. The enemies fall through them too.
Challenge
These tricky little levels were composed by Peter, Simon, Genevieve and their father Ian Wadham. They use traditional playing rules. Enjoy!
Easy Start
Drop through the false brick under the bar.
Mobile Bricks
Just run over the enemies' heads.
The Big Haul
Advance to the right and trap the oncoming enemies. Now retreat under the enemies who are falling behind you, then dig, dig, dig and kill all the enemies. Now go right and clear out all the brick and ladder structures in right-to-left order.
Quick Off The Mark
Move very quickly to the left to start. Keep digging until the enemies have brought down all the gold. Retreat to higher ground and dig there, if necessary.
Who Needs Enemies?
Keep digging rows of three bricks next to the ladder.
Asymmetrical
Leave the bottom left nugget till last. False bricks give you access to most of the nuggets, but they are not symmetrically placed.
Goldrunner Prophecy
Peter W. composed this in 1985. Do you see the prophetic letters GR? Spooky! When you collect the row of gold at bottom left, wait there and the first enemy will obligingly fall into the pit above you. When you move over to the right side, collect all nuggets except the three hanging under a ladder. Leave them till last. To get the gold above the trapped enemy, climb the ladder, dig down four bricks, wait till they start to re-appear, then dig one more, climb back up, re-dig the first two and the way will be clear to fall in, collect the gold and escape over the enemy's head. When you release the enemy, retreat quickly to where you can trap and kill him. After one or two tries he will re-appear harmlessly over on the left.
The Rosette
Try to get all the enemies together, by going to the middle then down. Now trap them in the trough at the bottom, ignoring the gold there for now. Stand on one side just above the trough, then drop down one square as the enemies get above the trough. Collect all the gold not in the trough, then release the enemies and lead them around over the tops of ladders, until they drop their gold.
He Has The Gold
The right hand enemy gets trapped holding some gold. You can kill him and destroy the gold by digging to the left of the small ladder. You may need to kill the other enemy and trap him in there too.
Towers of Gold
Before you kill any enemies, you must collect all the gold in the tops of the towers and above the bars. One place to get started is just under the second tower from the left. Dig once to trap the first enemy that comes towards you, run right to clear some gold, step back and trap the second enemy just to the left of the third tower. Now run right, with three enemies in hot pursuit and very much alive!
The Box
Dig the two bricks next to a ladder, then look for fall-through bricks.
Delayed Drop
The enemy on the left falls before you can get past the one on the right. So stay up there with him, repeatedly digging one hole and trapping him, until the second enemy gets back up the ladders and well clear of the concrete.
Maze of Ladders
Move to left of centre and go high, then you can drop and move left or right to get all the gold. Leave the nugget in the U-shaped space till last. Ignore the enemy. Let him stay trapped.
Ride Them Down
Quickly get the first two enemies into the double pit to the left of the gold. First get both of them into the little box, then release them left. Now fall onto them and collect the gold, then ride the third enemy down and use him to get across to the ladder.
Hair's Breadth Timing
At top centre dig two bricks. As they re-appear, dig two more, run across the top and dig next to the short ladder. Drop in and collect the gold. You have no time to spare! Clear the bottom left last. To go right, fall into a false brick under a short ladder, then climb along just under the concrete. In the middle of the right hand side, stand under the right hand bar next to the hole, dig left, drop into a false brick, then dig twice more, moving down and left. Lastly, stand on the short ladder, dig your escape brick on the right, run like mad round to the hole, drop in, collect the gold, fall through some bricks and dig again to escape.
The Three Musketeers
You have to kill all three Musketeers, so that they fill the false bricks under the gap in the bars at the top. Ignore d'Artagnan at the bottom right. You only walk over him to get a nugget. Collect the gold left to right across the bottom of the play area, then right to left across the top. Be sure to leave the nugget left of centre on the concrete. Collect that one last. Before you do so, dig away a row of three bricks above and to the left of it, then exit to the next level along roughly the same route as you used earlier.
Rat Trap
Move ultra-quickly to trap the two enemies and run over them. If you wait till they are almost touching you, they may both survive, then you can run up and around to the bottom right, descend the ladder to the concrete and trap them permanently in the nearby pit. If one gets stuck in the tower structure, use the same trick. There are false bricks in the bottom of the tower. If one is trapped and still has some gold, dig one hole at the right hand end of the pit, go back down the ladder and lead the enemy to his death, whereupon the gold will be destroyed.
Head Case
This is a warmup for a later level. To get the gold at the right, descend onto the enemy's head, release him to the left, move left after him and, as you ride down on his head, dig right. You can then run in, get the gold and exit before the brick closes. If you move to the bottom right corner, you can get the enemy to fall into the hole containing gold.
Under the Stairs
Start by killing the enemies. When they fall into the space at the right, move down and to the left to get them to drop further in and stop them getting the gold. If they go more than one third of the way in, they will be permanently trapped. Now tackle the three dig-and-run puzzles. You may have to make several trips to empty an area. Finally, collect the rightmost nugget.
Bertie Beetle
The top of this one is similar to the Head Case level (13). Trap the enemy to the right near the top of the ladder. Run down the ladder part way and get him to fall into the first of the pits. You will need to repeat this a few times. Now you must get the enemy into the pit at the far bottom left, so that you can run over him as you get the gold from inside the beetle. Trap the enemy at the end of the row of bricks under the beetle's antennae. Stand on his head, dig right and drop down. Step right, dig left and trap him again as he runs in after you. Run down to the left, dig the brick to the right of the pit and trap him again. Collect the nugget, dig left and escape left onto the concrete. As the enemy climbs out he will fall into the pit.
Short Circuit
Go anti-clockwise around the circuit and take an enemy with you, trapping him in the pits at bottom left, lower right and upper right. Then you can run across the concrete and collect the gold up there. Next, clear out all of the left side except for one nugget above a ladder. To get this one, release the second enemy and take him all the way around the circuit. Follow him up the long ladder, staying on it till he runs over to the left and falls. Now go to the left end of the concrete as he circulates around the left side of the play area. As he falls past your feet, run over to the small ladder and get the gold. To get past the lower left pit, stand on the enemy and dig left. When you fall, dig right and escape, but stay low until the bricks close, then you can use the short ladder to lead the enemy up, across, down and out. To operate the lower right pit, go and get the gold in the centre of the circuit, then dig each side of the short ladder there. Fall to the left as the enemy is caught on the right. When the enemy emerges, he will go right and drop into the pit. Stand on his head and dig left to release him. You can push the enemy up the right hand ladder and to the left by standing a little way from the bottom of the ladder. You will need careful timing and digging to get him into the top right pit. Once there, you can run over him. If he still has gold, stand to the left of the pit and dig repeatedly until he drops the gold somewhere on his rounds.
Synchronised Running
Yes, you must run on the enemy's head --- all the way across! All it takes is a steady hand.

Sorry, there is no further information about this game.
This level number is not valid. It can not be used.
The main button at the bottom echoes the menu action you selected. Click it after choosing a game and level - or use "Cancel".
If this is your first time in KGoldrunner, select the tutorial game, which gives you hints as you go. Otherwise, just click on the name of a game in the table, then, to start at level 001, click on the main button at the bottom. Play begins when you move the mouse or press a key.
You can select System levels for editing (or copying), but you must save the result in a game you have created. Use the left mouse-button as a paintbrush and the editor toolbar buttons as a palette. Use the'Erase 'button or the right mouse-button to erase. You can drag the mouse with a button held down and paint or erase multiple squares.
You can add a name and hint to your new level here, but you must save the level you have created into one of your own games. By default your new level will go at the end of your game, but you can also select a level number and save into the middle of your game.
You can create or edit a name and hint here, before saving. If you change the game or level, you can do a copy or "Save As", but you must always save into one of your own games. If you save a level into the middle of a series, the other levels are automatically re-numbered.
You can only delete levels from one of your own games. If you delete a level from the middle of a series, the other levels are automatically re-numbered.
To move (re-number) a level, you must first select it by using "Edit Any Level...", then you can use "Move Level..." to move it to a new number or even a different game. Other levels are automatically re-numbered as required. You can only move levels within your own games.
When editing game info you only need to choose a game, then you can go to a dialog where you edit the details of the game.
Click on the table to choose a game. In the table and below it you can see more information about the selected game, including how many levels there are, how difficult the game is and what rules the enemies follow (see the KGoldrunner Handbook). You select a level number by typing it or using the spin box or scroll bar. As you vary the game or level, the thumbnail area shows a preview of your choice.

Digital Camera This module allows you to configure support for your digital camera. You need to select the camera's model and the port it is connected to on your computer (e. g. USB, Serial, Firewire). If your camera does not appear on the list of Supported Cameras, go to the GPhoto web site for a possible update. To view and download images from the digital camera, go to the address camera: / in Konqueror and other KDE applications.

Monitor Gamma This is a tool for changing monitor gamma correction. Use the four sliders to define the gamma correction either as a single value, or separately for the red, green and blue components. You may need to correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good results. The test images help you to find proper settings. You can save them system-wide to XF86Config (root access is required for that) or to your own KDE settings. On multi head systems you can correct the gamma values separately for all screens.

Acquiring & Screenshots
To acquire a screenshot, press %1. The screenshot will be placed into the clipboard and you will be able to paste it in KolourPaint. You may configure the Desktop Screenshot shortcut in the KDE System Settings module Keyboard Shortcuts. Alternatively, you may try the application KSnapshot.
You do not appear to be running KDE. Once you have loaded KDE: To acquire a screenshot, press %1. The screenshot will be placed into the clipboard and you will be able to paste it in KolourPaint. Alternatively, you may try the application KSnapshot.
Acquiring Screenshots
The image to be pasted may have more colors than the current screen mode can support. In order to display it, some color information may be removed. If you save this image, any color loss will become permanent. To avoid this issue, increase your screen depth to at least %1bpp and then restart KolourPaint. It also contains translucency which is not fully supported. The translucency data will be approximated with a 1-bit transparency mask. If you save this image, this loss of translucency will become permanent.

This is a list of available indentation modes. The specified indentation mode will be used for all new documents. Be aware that it is also possible to set the indentation mode with document variables, modes or a. kateconfig file.
Indentation Properties
Indentation width:
The indentation width is the number of spaces which is used to indent a line. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is disabled, a Tab character is inserted if the indentation is divisible by the tab width.
If this option is disabled, changing the indentation level aligns a line to a multiple of the width specified in Indentation width.
Keep extra spaces
If this option is selected, pasted code from the clipboard is indented. Triggering the undo -action removes the indentation.
Adjust indentation of code pasted from the clipboard
Indentation Actions
If this option is selected, the Backspace key decreases the indentation level if the cursor is located in the leading blank space of a line.
Backspace key in leading blank space unindents
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Tab key action (if no selection exists )< a href="If you want Tab to align the current line in the current code block like in emacs, make Tab a shortcut to the action Align." > More...
If this option is selected, the Tab key always inserts white space so that the next tab postion is reached. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Always advance to the next tab position
If this option is selected, the Tab key always indents the current line by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width.
Always increase indentation level
If this option is selected, the Tab key either indents the current line or advances to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space character in the line, or if there is a selection, the current line is indented by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no selection, white space is inserted so that the next tab postion is reached: if the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Increase indentation level if in leading blank space
File Format
& Encoding:
Encoding autodetection:
End of line:
UNIX
DOS/ Windows
Macintosh
If this option is enabled the editor will autodetect the end of line type. The first found end of line type will be used for the whole file.
Automatic end of line detection
Automatic Cleanups on Load/ Save
The editor will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text while loading/ saving the file. This change is only visible after a save if you reload the file.
Remove trailing spaces
Folder Config File
Search & depth for config file:
The editor will search the given number of folder levels upwards for a. kateconfig file and load the settings line from it.
Do not use config file
Backing up on save will cause Kate to copy the disk file to'lt; prefixgt; lt; filenamegt; lt; suffixgt; 'before saving changes. The suffix defaults to ~ and prefix is empty by default.
Backup on Save
If this option is enabled, backups for local files will be created when saving.
& Local files
If this option is enabled, backups for remote files will be created when saving.
& Remote files
& Prefix:
Enter the prefix to prepend to the backup file names.
& Suffix:
Enter the suffix to append to the backup file names.
& Auto completion enabled
Ignore white space changes
Calculates the difference between the editor contents and the disk file using diff(1).
& View Difference
Dynamic & word wrap indicators (if applicable):
Choose when the Dynamic Word Wrap Indicators should be displayed.
Align dynamically wrapped lines to indentation depth:
Enables the start of dynamically wrapped lines to be aligned vertically to the indentation level of the first line. This can help to make code and markup more readable. Additionally, this allows you to set a maximum width of the screen, as a percentage, after which dynamically wrapped lines will no longer be vertically aligned. For example, at 50%, lines whose indentation levels are deeper than 50% of the width of the screen will not have vertical alignment applied to subsequent wrapped lines.
% of View Width
Borders
If this option is checked, every new view will display marks for code folding, if code folding is available.
Show & folding markers (if available)
If this option is checked, every new view will display an icon border on the left hand side. The icon border shows bookmark signs, for instance.
Show & icon border
If this option is checked, every new view will display line numbers on the left hand side.
Show & line numbers
If this option is checked, every new view will show marks on the vertical scrollbar. These marks will show bookmarks, for instance.
Show & scrollbar marks
Choose how the bookmarks should be ordered in the Bookmarks menu.
Sort Bookmarks Menu
Each new bookmark will be added to the bottom, independently from where it is placed in the document.
By creation
The bookmarks will be ordered by the line numbers they are placed at.
By & position
If this is enabled, the editor will display vertical lines to help identify indent lines.
Show indentation lines
Tabulators
If this is enabled, the editor will calculate the number of spaces up to the next tab position as defined by the tab width, and insert that number of spaces instead of a TAB character.
& Insert spaces instead of tabulators
The editor will display a symbol to indicate the presence of a tab in the text.
& Highlight tabulators
Tab width:
Static Word Wrap
Automatically start a new line of text when the current line exceeds the length specified by the Wrap words at: option. This option does not wrap existing lines of text - use the Apply Static Word Wrap option in the Tools menu for that purpose. If you want lines to be visually wrapped instead, according to the width of the view, enable Dynamic Word Wrap in the View Defaults config page.
Enable static & word wrap
If this option is checked, a vertical line will be drawn at the word wrap column as defined in the Editing properties. Note that the word wrap marker is only drawn if you use a fixed pitch font.
Show static word wrap marker (if applicable)
Wrap words at:
If the Word Wrap option is selected this entry determines the length (in characters) at which the editor will automatically start a new line.
Misc
If this is enabled, the editor will remove any trailing whitespace on lines when they are left by the insertion cursor.
Remove & trailing spaces while editing

About KDE
KDE - Be Free! Platform Version %1
KDEis a world-wide network of software engineers, artists, writers, translators and facilitators who are committed to Free Softwaredevelopment. This community has created hundreds of Free Software applications as part of the KDE Development Platform and KDE Software Distribution. KDE is a cooperative enterprise in which no single entity controls the efforts or products of KDE to the exclusion of others. Everyone is welcome to join and contribute to KDE, including you. Visit http://www.kde.orgfor more information about the KDE community and the software we produce.
Software can always be improved, and the KDE team isready to do so. However, you - the user - must tell us when something does not work as expected or could be done better. KDE has a bug tracking system. Visit http://bugs.kde.orgor use the "Report Bug..." dialog from the "Help" menu to report bugs. If you have a suggestion for improvement then you are welcome to use the bug tracking system to register your wish. Make sure you use the severity called "Wishlist".
You do not have to be a software developer to be a member of the KDE team. You can join the national teams that translate program interfaces. You can provide graphics, themes, sounds, and improved documentation. You decide! Visit http://www.kde.org/jobs/for information on some projects in which you can participate. If you need more information or documentation, then a visit to http://techbase.kde.orgwill provide you with what you need.
KDE is available free of charge, but costs are incurred and assets formed in its creation. Thus, the KDE community formed KDE e.V., a non-profit organization legally founded in Tuebingen, Germany. KDE e.V. represents the KDE community in legal and financial matters. See http://www.kde-ev.orgfor information on KDE e.V. KDE benefits from financial support. Most of the funds raised are used to reimburse members and others for expenses they incur when contributing to KDE. You are encouraged to support KDE through a financial donation, using one of the ways described at http://www.kde.org/support/. Thank you very much in advance for your support.

Technical reason:
Details of the request:
URL: %1
Protocol: %1
Date and time: %1
Additional information: %1
Possible causes:
Possible solutions:
Contact your appropriate computer support system, whether the system administrator, or technical support group for further assistance.
Contact the administrator of the server for further assistance.
Check your access permissions on this resource.
Your access permissions may be inadequate to perform the requested operation on this resource.
The file may be in use (and thus locked) by another user or application.
Check to make sure that no other application or user is using the file or has locked the file.

You may have encountered a bug in the program.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Update your software to the latest version. Your distribution should provide tools to update your software.
When all else fails, please consider helping the KDE team or the third party maintainer of this software by submitting a high quality bug report. If the software is provided by a third party, please contact them directly. Otherwise, first look to see if the same bug has been submitted by someone else by searching at the KDE bug reporting website. If not, take note of the details given above, and include them in your bug report, along with as many other details as you think might help.
There may have been a problem with your network connection.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
There may have been a problem at some point along the network path between the server and this computer.
Try again, either now or at a later time.
A protocol error or incompatibility may have occurred.
Ensure that the resource exists, and try again.
The specified resource may not exist.
You may have incorrectly typed the location.
Double-check that you have entered the correct location and try again.

Cannot Open Resource For Reading
This means that the contents of the requested file or folder %1 could not be retrieved, as read access could not be obtained.
You may not have permissions to read the file or open the folder.
Cannot Open Resource For Writing
This means that the file, %1, could not be written to as requested, because access with permission to write could not be obtained.
Cannot Initiate the %1 Protocol
Unable to Launch Process
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not be started. This is usually due to technical reasons.
The program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of KDE. This can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start.
Internal Error
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error.
Improperly Formatted URL
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered was not properly formatted. The format of a URL is generally as follows: protocol: / /user: password@www. example. org: port/ folder/ filename. extension? query=value
Unsupported Protocol %1
The protocol %1 is not supported by the KDE programs currently installed on this computer.
The requested protocol may not be supported.
The versions of the %1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible.
You may perform a search on the Internet for a KDE program (called a kioslave or ioslave) which supports this protocol. Places to search include http: / /kde-apps. org/ and http: / /freshmeat. net/.
URL Does Not Refer to a Resource.
Protocol is a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol; the protocol specified is only for use in such situations, however this is not one of these situations. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unsupported Action: %1
The requested action is not supported by the KDE program which is implementing the %1 protocol.
This error is very much dependent on the KDE program. The additional information should give you more information than is available to the KDE input/ output architecture.
Attempt to find another way to accomplish the same outcome.
File Expected
The request expected a file, however the folder %1 was found instead.
This may be an error on the server side.
Folder Expected
The request expected a folder, however the file %1 was found instead.
File or Folder Does Not Exist
The specified file or folder %1 does not exist.
The requested file could not be created because a file with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current file out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current file and try again.
Choose an alternate filename for the new file.
The requested folder could not be created because a folder with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current folder out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current folder and try again.
Choose an alternate name for the new folder.
Unknown Host
An unknown host error indicates that the server with the requested name, %1, could not be located on the Internet.
The name that you typed, %1, may not exist: it may be incorrectly typed.
Access Denied
Access was denied to the specified resource, %1.
You may have supplied incorrect authentication details or none at all.
Your account may not have permission to access the specified resource.
Retry the request and ensure your authentication details are entered correctly.
Write Access Denied
This means that an attempt to write to the file %1 was rejected.
Unable to Enter Folder
This means that an attempt to enter (in other words, to open) the requested folder %1 was rejected.
Folder Listing Unavailable
Protocol %1 is not a Filesystem
This means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder, and the KDE program supporting this protocol is unable to do so.
Cyclic Link Detected
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop, and try again.
Request Aborted By User
The request was not completed because it was aborted.
Retry the request.
Cyclic Link Detected During Copy
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. During the requested copy operation, KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Could Not Create Network Connection
Could Not Create Socket
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be created.
The network connection may be incorrectly configured, or the network interface may not be enabled.
Connection to Server Refused
The server %1 refused to allow this computer to make a connection.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be configured to allow requests.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be running the requested service (%1).
A network firewall (a device which restricts Internet requests), either protecting your network or the network of the server, may have intervened, preventing this request.
Connection to Server Closed Unexpectedly
Although a connection was established to %1, the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication.
A protocol error may have occurred, causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error.
URL Resource Invalid
Protocol %1 is not a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource, %1%2.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol. This request specified a protocol be used as such, however this protocol is not capable of such an action. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unable to Initialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Mount Device
The requested device could not be initialized ("mounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may not be ready, for example there may be no media in a removable media device (i. e. no CD-ROM in a CD drive), or in the case of a peripheral/ portable device, the device may not be correctly connected.
You may not have permissions to initialize ("mount") the device. On UNIX systems, often system administrator privileges are required to initialize a device.
Check that the device is ready; removable drives must contain media, and portable devices must be connected and powered on.; and try again.
Unable to Uninitialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Unmount Device
The requested device could not be uninitialized ("unmounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may be busy, that is, still in use by another application or user. Even such things as having an open browser window on a location on this device may cause the device to remain in use.
You may not have permissions to uninitialize ("unmount") the device. On UNIX systems, system administrator privileges are often required to uninitialize a device.
Check that no applications are accessing the device, and try again.
Cannot Read From Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while reading the contents of the resource.
You may not have permissions to read from the resource.
Cannot Write to Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while writing to the resource.
You may not have permissions to write to the resource.
Could Not Listen for Network Connections
Could Not Bind
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be established to listen for incoming network connections.
Could Not Listen
Could Not Accept Network Connection
This is a fairly technical error in which an error occurred while attempting to accept an incoming network connection.
You may not have permissions to accept the connection.
Could Not Login: %1
An attempt to login to perform the requested operation was unsuccessful.
Could Not Determine Resource Status
Could Not Stat Resource
An attempt to determine information about the status of the resource %1, such as the resource name, type, size, etc., was unsuccessful.
The specified resource may not have existed or may not be accessible.
Could Not Cancel Listing
FIXME: Document this
Could Not Create Folder
An attempt to create the requested folder failed.
The location where the folder was to be created may not exist.
Could Not Remove Folder
An attempt to remove the specified folder, %1, failed.
The specified folder may not exist.
The specified folder may not be empty.
Ensure that the folder exists and is empty, and try again.
Could Not Resume File Transfer
The specified request asked that the transfer of file %1 be resumed at a certain point of the transfer. This was not possible.
The protocol, or the server, may not support file resuming.
Retry the request without attempting to resume transfer.
Could Not Rename Resource
An attempt to rename the specified resource %1 failed.
Could Not Alter Permissions of Resource
An attempt to alter the permissions on the specified resource %1 failed.
Could Not Change Ownership of Resource
An attempt to change the ownership of the specified resource %1 failed.

Unexpected Program Termination
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has unexpectedly terminated.
Out of Memory
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not obtain the memory required to continue.
Unknown Proxy Host
While retrieving information about the specified proxy host, %1, an Unknown Host error was encountered. An unknown host error indicates that the requested name could not be located on the Internet.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration, specifically your proxy's hostname. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
Double-check your proxy settings and try again.
Authentication Failed: Method %1 Not Supported
Although you may have supplied the correct authentication details, the authentication failed because the method that the server is using is not supported by the KDE program implementing the protocol %1.
Please file a bug at http: / /bugs. kde. org/ to inform the KDE team of the unsupported authentication method.
Request Aborted

This list should show the types of file that your application can handle. This list is organized by mimetypes. MIME, Multipurpose Internet (e)Mail Extension, is a standard protocol for identifying the type of data based on filename extensions and correspondent mimetypes. Example: the "bmp" part that comes after the dot in flower. bmp indicates that it is a specific kind of image, image/ x-bmp. To know which application should open each type of file, the system should be informed about the abilities of each application to handle these extensions and mimetypes. If you want to associate this application with one or more mimetypes that are not in this list, click on the button Add below. If there are one or more filetypes that this application cannot handle, you may want to remove them from the list clicking on the button Remove below.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the %1 text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the %2 text area when you click Save, %3 will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.

KWallet - The KDE Wallet System
Welcome to KWallet, the KDE Wallet System. KWallet allows you to store your passwords and other personal information on disk in an encrypted file, preventing others from viewing the information. This wizard will tell you about KWallet and help you configure it for the first time.
& Basic setup (recommended)
& Advanced setup
Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.
Yes, I wish to use the KDE wallet to store my personal information.
Enter a new password:
Verify password:
The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.
The KDE Wallet system allows you to control the level of security of your personal data. Some of these settings do impact usability. While the default settings are generally acceptable for most users, you may wish to change some of them. You may further tune these settings from the KWallet control module.

Currently used file name schemes
Here you can see the currently configured file name schemes which the "Suggest" button in the tag editor uses to extract tag information from a file name. Each string may contain one of the following placeholders: %t: Title %a: Artist %A: Album %T: Track %c: Comment For example, the file name scheme "[%T] %a - %t" would match "[01] Deep Purple - Smoke on the water" but not "(Deep Purple) Smoke on the water". For that second name, you would use the scheme "(%a) %t". Note that the order in which the schemes appear in the list is relevant, since the tag guesser will go through the list from the top to the bottom, and use the first matching scheme.

Cool artist - example audio file. wav
Audio CDs The Audio CD IO-Slave enables you to easily create wav, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files from your audio CD-ROMs or DVDs. The slave is invoked by typing "audiocd: /" in Konqueror's location bar. In this module, you can configure encoding, and device settings. Note that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis encoding are only available if KDE was built with a recent version of the LAME or Ogg Vorbis libraries.

Specify a location for the drive you want to use. Normally, this is a file inside the / dev folder representing your CD or DVD drive.
& Specify CD Device:
Uncheck this if you want to specify a CD device different from the one autoprobed
Use & error correction when reading the CD
If you uncheck this option, the slave will not try to use error correction which can be useful for reading damaged CDs. However, this feature can be problematic in some cases, so you can switch it off here.

Unknown error. If you have a cd in the drive try running cdparanoia -vsQ as yourself (not root). Do you see a track list? If not, make sure you have permission to access the CD device. If you are using SCSI emulation (possible if you have an IDE CD writer) then make sure you check that you have read and write permissions on the generic SCSI device, which is probably / dev/ sg0, / dev/ sg1, etc.. If it still does not work, try typing audiocd: / ?device=/ dev/ sg0 (or similar) to tell kio_audiocd which device your CD-ROM is.

Uninvited Connections
Allow & uninvited connections
Select this option to allow connecting without inviting. This is useful if you want to access your desktop remotely.
Announce service & on the network
If you allow uninvited connections and enable this option, Desktop Sharing will announce the service and your identity on the local network, so people can find you and your computer.
Confirm uninvited connections & before accepting
If enabled, a dialog will appear when somebody attempts to connect, asking you whether you want to accept the connection.
Allow uninvited connections to control the desktop
Enable this option to allow uninvited user to control your desktop (using mouse and keyboard).
Password:
If you allow uninvited connections, it is highly recommended to set a password in order to protect your computer from unauthorized access.
& Session
Session Preferences
Always disable & background image
Check this option to always disable the background image during a remote session. Otherwise the client decides whether the background will be enabled or disabled.
& Network
Network Port
Assign port automatically
Check this option to assign the network port automatically. This is recommended unless your network setup requires you to use a fixed port, for example because of a firewall.
Port:
Enter the TCP port number here
Use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service. Note that if the port is already in use the Desktop Sharing service will not be accessible until you free it. It is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing. Most VNC clients use a display number instead of the actual port. This display number is the offset to port 5900, so port 5901 has the display number 1.

Host Properties
& Name/ address:
Name / Address field Here you can enter the host name or address. The host may be specified in a number of ways: single host This is the most common format. You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).
& Public access
Public access If you check this, the host address will be a single wildcard, which means public access. This is just the same as if you would enter a wildcard in the address field.
Options
& Writable
Writable Allow both read and write requests on this NFS volume. The default is to disallow any request which changes the filesystem
& Insecure
Insecure If this option is checked, it is not required that requests originate on an internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). If unsure leave it unchecked.
& Sync
Sync This option requests that all file writes be committed to disk before the write request completes. This is required for complete safety of data in the face of a server crash, but incurs a performance hit. The default is to allow the server to write the data out whenever it is ready.
No wdelay
No wdelay This option only has effect if sync is also set. The NFS server will normally delay committing a write request to disk slightly if it suspects that another related write request may be in progress or may arrive soon. This allows multiple write requests to be committed to disk with the one operation which can improve performance. If an NFS server received mainly small unrelated requests, this behavior could actually reduce performance, so no wdelay is available to turn it off.
No & hide
No hide This option is based on the option of the same name provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is mounted. That filesystem is "hidden". Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not to be hidden, and an appropriately authorized client will be able to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing the change. However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode number. The nohide option is currently only effective on single host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports. This option can be very useful in some situations, but it should be used with due care, and only after confirming that the client system copes with the situation effectively.
No subtree check
No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.
Insecure locks
Insecure locks This option tells the NFS server not to require authentication of locking requests (i. e. requests which use the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be performed. Early NFS client implementations did not send credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are world readable.
User Mapping
All squash
All squash Map all uids and gids to the anonymous user. Useful for NFS-exported public FTP directories, news spool directories, etc.
No & root squash
No root squash Turn of root squashing. This option is mainly useful for diskless clients. root squashing Map requests from uid/ gid 0 to the anonymous uid/ gid. Note that this does not apply to any other uids that might be equally sensitive, such as user bin.
Anonym. & UID:
Anonym. UID/ GID These options explicitly set the uid and gid of the anonymous account. This option is primarily useful for PC/ NFS clients, where you might want all requests appear to be from one user.

SSL
Enables or disables the entire SSL mode
This enables or disables the entire SSL mode. If it is set to no, the SSL-enabled Samba behaves exactly like the non-SSL Samba. If set to yes, it depends on the variables ssl hosts and ssl hosts resign whether an SSL connection will be required. This is only available if the SSL libraries have been compiled on your system and the configure option --with-ssl was given at configure time.

Guests
This is a username which will be used for access to services which are specified as guest ok. Whatever privileges this user has will be available to any client connecting to the guest service. Typically this user will exist in the password file, but will not have a valid login. The user account \\"ftp\\ "is often a good choice for this parameter. If a username is specified in a given service, the specified username overrides this one.
& Guest account:
If this is checked, then no password is required to connect to the service. Privileges will be those of the guest account.
Only allow guest connections
Hosts
The opposite of hosts allow - hosts listed here are NOT permitted access to services unless the specific services have their own lists to override this one. Where the lists conflict, the allow list takes precedence.
This parameter is a comma, space, or tab delimited set of hosts which are permitted to access a service.

Samba Configuration here you can configure your SAMBA server.
Use the share security level if you have a home network or a small office network. It allows everyone to read the list of all your shared directories and printers before a login is required.
Use the user security level if you have a bigger network and you do not want to allow everyone to read your list of shared directories and printers without a login. If you want to run your Samba server as a Primary Domain controller (PDC) you also have to set this option.
Use the server security level if you have a big network and the samba server should validate the username/ password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box.
Use the domain security level if you have a big network and the samba server should validate the username/ password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller.
Use the ADS security level if you have a big network and the samba server should act as a domain member in an ADS realm.

Use this to specify the performance of your connection. Note that you should select the speed of the weakest link - even if you have a high speed connection, it will not help you if the remote computer uses a slow modem. Choosing a level of quality that is too high on a slow link will cause slower response times. Choosing a lower quality will increase latencies in high speed connections and results in lower image quality, especially in'Low Quality 'mode.

& Manage Invitations (%1)...
An invitation creates a one-time password that allows the receiver to connect to your desktop. It is valid for only one successful connection and will expire after an hour if it has not been used. When somebody connects to your computer a dialog will appear and ask you for permission. The connection will not be established before you accept it. In this dialog you can also restrict the other person to view your desktop only, without the ability to move your mouse pointer or press keys. If you want to create a permanent password for Desktop Sharing, allow'Uninvited Connections' in the configuration.

Personal Invitation
Desktop Sharing uses the VNC protocol. You can use any VNC client to connect. In KDE the client is called'Remote Desktop Connection '. Enter the host information into the client and it will connect..
This field contains the address of your computer and the display number, separated by a colon. The address is just a hint - you can use any address that can reach your computer. Desktop Sharing tries to guess your address from your network configuration, but does not always succeed in doing so. If your computer is behind a firewall it may have a different address or be unreachable for other computers.

Invitations are normally sent as attachments to a mail. This switch changes the invitation mails to be sent in the text of the mail instead; this is necessary to send invitations and replies to Microsoft Outlook. But, when you do this, you no longer get descriptive text that mail programs can read; so, to people who have email programs that do not understand the invitations, the resulting messages look very odd. People that have email programs that do understand invitations will still be able to work with this.

Act on new/ unread mail in this folder
If this option is enabled then you will be notified about new/ unread mail in this folder. Moreover, going to the next/ previous folder with unread messages will stop at this folder. Uncheck this option if you do not want to be notified about new/ unread mail in this folder and if you want this folder to be skipped when going to the next/ previous folder with unread messages. This is useful for ignoring any new/ unread mail in your trash and spam folder.
Include this folder in mail checks
Keep replies in this folder
Check this option if you want replies you write to mails in this folder to be put in this same folder after sending, instead of in the configured sent-mail folder.
Hide this folder in the folder selection dialog
Use & default identity
& Sender identity:
Select the sender identity to be used when writing new mail or replying to mail in this folder. This means that if you are in one of your work folders, you can make KMail use the corresponding sender email address, signature and signing or encryption keys automatically. Identities can be set up in the main configuration dialog. (Settings - > Configure KMail)
& Folder contents:
Generate free/ busy and activate alarms for:
Nobody
Admins of This Folder
All Readers of This Folder
This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.
This setting allows you to disable alarms for folders shared by others.
Block free/ busy and alarms locally
You have configured this folder to contain groupware information and the general configuration option to hide groupware folders is set. That means that this folder will disappear once the configuration dialog is closed. If you want to remove the folder again, you will need to temporarily disable hiding of groupware folders to be able to see it.

Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

& Automatically sign messages
When this option is enabled, all messages you send will be signed by default; of course, it is still possible to disable signing for each message individually.
Encrypting
When this option is enabled, the message/ file will not only be encrypted with the receiver's public key, but also with your key. This will enable you to decrypt the message/ file at a later time. This is generally a good idea.
Show signed/ encrypted text after composing
When this option is enabled, the signed/ encrypted text will be shown in a separate window, enabling you to know how it will look before it is sent. This is a good idea when you are verifying that your encryption system works.
Store sent messages encrypted
Check to store messages encrypted
Store Messages Encrypted When this box is checked, sent messages are stored encrypted like they were sent. This is not recommended, as you will not be able to read the messages any longer if a necessary certificate expires. However, there may be local rules that require you to turn this option on. When in doubt, check with your local administrator.
Always show the encryption keys & for approval
When this option is enabled, the application will always show you a list of public keys from which you can choose the one it will use for encryption. If it is off, the application will only show the dialog if it cannot find the right key or if there are several which could be used.
Automatically encrypt & messages whenever possible
When this option is enabled, every message you send will be encrypted whenever encryption is possible and desired; of course, it is still possible to disable the automatic encryption for each message individually.

HTML Messages
WARNING: Allowing HTML in email may increase the risk that your system will be compromised by present and anticipated security exploits. More about HTML mails... More about external references...
Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.
Prefer HTML to plain text
Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.
Allow messages to load external references from the Internet

Message Disposition Notifications
Send policy:
Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

HTTP Requests

Do not perform any HTTP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the LDAP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

Primary host for LDAP requests:
Entering a LDAP server here will make all LDAP requests go to that server first. More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

Exchange-compatible invitation naming
Automatic invitation sending
When this is checked, you will not see the mail composer window. Instead, all invitation mails are sent automatically. If you want to see the mail before sending it, you can uncheck this option. However, be aware that the text in the composer window is in iCalendar syntax, and you should not try modifying it by hand.
Enabling this makes it possible to store the entries from the Kontact applications (KOrganizer, KAddressBook, and KNotes.) If you want to set this option you must also set the applications to use the IMAP resource; this is done in the KDE System Settings.
Usually you will not have any reason to see the folders that hold the IMAP resources. But if you need to see them, you can set that here.
If the account used for storing groupware information is not used to manage normal mail, set this option to make KMail only show groupware folders in it. This is useful if you are handling regular mail via an additional online IMAP account.
Choose the storage format of the groupware folders. The default format is to use the ical (for calendar folders) and vcard (for address book folders) standards. This format makes all Kontact features available. The Kolab XML format uses a custom model that matches more closely the one used in Outlook. This format gives better Outlook compatibility, when using a Kolab server or a compatible solution.
This chooses the parent of the IMAP resource folders. By default, the Kolab server sets the IMAP inbox to be the parent.
This is the ID of the account holding the IMAP resource folders.
If you want to set the folder names of the IMAP storage to your local language, you can choose between these available languages. Please note, that the only reason to do so is for compatibility with Microsoft Outlook. It is considered a bad idea to set this, since it makes changing languages impossible. So do not set this unless you have to.
Only filter mails received in disconnected IMAP inbox.
Also filter new mails received in groupware folders.

This is the list of defined filters. They are processed top-to-bottom. Click on any filter to edit it using the controls in the right-hand half of the dialog.
Click this button to create a new filter. The filter will be inserted just before the currently-selected one, but you can always change that later on. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to copy a filter. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to delete the currently-selected filter from the list above. There is no way to get the filter back once it is deleted, but you can always leave the dialog by clicking Cancel to discard the changes made.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter up one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Down button.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter down one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Up button.
Click this button to rename the currently-selected filter. Filters are named automatically, as long as they start with "lt;". If you have renamed a filter accidentally and want automatic naming back, click this button and select Clear followed by OK in the appearing dialog.
Check this button to force the confirmation dialog to be displayed. This is useful if you have defined a ruleset that tags messages to be downloaded later. Without the possibility to force the dialog popup, these messages could never be downloaded if no other large messages were waiting on the server, or if you wanted to change the ruleset to tag the messages differently.

The server does not seem to support unique message numbers, but this is a requirement for leaving messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn leaving fetched messages on the server on.
The server does not seem to support fetching message headers, but this is a requirement for filtering messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn filtering messages on the server on.
Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.
Please specify a server and port on the General tab first.
The server does not seem to support pipelining; therefore, this option has been disabled. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on. But please note that this feature can cause some POP servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupt messages. So before using this feature with important mail you should first test it by sending yourself a larger number of test messages which you all download in one go from the POP server.

The wizard will replace the following filters: %1
The wizard will search for any tools to do spam detection and setup KMail to work with them.
Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to use some commonly-known anti-virus tools. The wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always append the new rules. Warning: As KMail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior.
Please select the tools to be used for the detection and go to the next page.
& Mark detected spam messages as read
Mark messages which have been classified as spam as read.
Move & known spam to:
The default folder for spam messages is the trash folder, but you may change that in the folder view below.
Move & probable spam to:
The default folder is the inbox folder, but you may change that in the folder view below. Not all tools support a classification as unsure. If you have not selected a capable tool, you cannot select a folder as well.
Check messages using the anti-virus tools
Let the anti-virus tools check your messages. The wizard will create appropriate filters. The messages are usually marked by the tools so that following filters can react on this and, for example, move virus messages to a special folder.
Move detected viral messages to the selected folder
A filter to detect messages classified as virus-infected and to move those messages into a predefined folder is created. The default folder is the trash folder, but you may change that in the folder view.
Additionally, mark detected viral messages as read
Mark messages which have been classified as virus-infected as read, as well as moving them to the selected folder.

KArmReminder
(c) 2006
Someone, probably you, has called karm.
KArm has been renamed to KTimeTracker. This makes it easier to recognize. Compatibility advice: Do not give ktimetracker files to karm users. Using karm files with ktimetracker is possible.
Please learn to call ktimetracker as this reminder may be removed in the future.

& Keep passphrase in memory
When this option is enabled, the passphrase of your private key will be remembered by the application as long as the application is running. Thus you will only have to enter the passphrase once. Be aware that this could be a security risk. If you leave your computer, others can use it to send signed messages and/ or read your encrypted messages. If a core dump occurs, the contents of your RAM will be saved onto disk, including your passphrase. Note that when using KMail, this setting only applies if you are not using gpg-agent. It is also ignored if you are using crypto plugins.
Always encrypt to self
When this option is enabled, the message/ file will not only be encrypted with the receiver's public key, but also with your key. This will enable you to decrypt the message/ file at a later time. This is generally a good idea.
& Show signed/ encrypted text after composing
When this option is enabled, the signed/ encrypted text will be shown in a separate window, enabling you to know how it will look before it is sent. This is a good idea when you are verifying that your encryption system works.
Always show the encryption keys & for approval
When this option is enabled, the application will always show you a list of public keys from which you can choose the one it will use for encryption. If it is off, the application will only show the dialog if it cannot find the right key or if there are several which could be used.

Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
& Name:
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Some emails, especially those generated automatically, do not specify the character encoding which needs to be used to properly display them. In such cases a fallback character encoding will be used, which you can configure here. Set it to the character encoding most commonly used in your part of the world. As a default the encoding configured for the whole system is used.
Changing this from its default'Auto 'will force the use of the specified encoding for all emails, regardless of what they specify themselves.

Kate comes with a nice set of plugins, providing simple and advanced features of all sorts. You can enable/ disable plugins to suit your needs in the configuration dialog, choose Settings -gt; configure to launch that.
You can swap the characters on each side of the cursor just by pressing Ctrl+T
You can export the current document as a HTML file, including syntax highlighting. Just choose File -gt; Export -gt; HTML...
You can split the Kate editor as many times as you like and in either direction. Each frame has its own status bar and can display any open document. Just choose View -gt; Split [Horizontal _BAR_ Vertical]
You can drag the Tool views (File List and File Selector) to any side that you want them in Kate, or stack them, or even tear them off the main window.
Kate has a built-in terminal emulator, just click on "Terminal" at the bottom to show or hide it as you desire.
Kate can highlight the current line with a different background color. _BAR_ You can set the color in the Colors page of the configuration dialog.
You can open the currently edited file in any other application from within Kate. Choose File -gt; Open With for the list of programs configured for the document type. There is also an option Other... to choose any application on your system.
You can configure the editor to always display the line numbers and/ or bookmark panes when started from the View Defaults page of the configuration dialog.
You can download new or updated Syntax highlight definitions from the Highlighting page in the configuration dialog. Just click the Download... button on the Open/ Save -gt; Modes & Filetypes tab (You have to be online, of course...).
You can cycle through all open documents by pressing Alt+Left or Alt+Right. The next/ previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame.
You can do cool sed-like regular expression replacements using Command Line. For example, press F7 and enter s / oldtext/ newtext/ g to replace & quot; oldtextquot; with & quot; newtextquot; throughout the current line.
You can repeat your last search by just pressing F3, or Shift+F3 if you want to search backwards.
You can filter the files displayed in the File Selector tool view. Simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom, for example: *. html *. php if you only want to see HTML and PHP files in the current folder. The File Selector will even remember your filters for you .< strong >
You can have two views - or even more - of the same document in Kate. Editing in either will be reflected in both. So if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document, just press Ctrl+Shift+T to split horizontally.
Press F8 or Shift+F8 to switch to the next/ previous frame.

Top Cost Call Stack
The Top Cost Call Stack This is a purely fictional'most probable 'call stack. It is built up by starting with the current selected function and adds the callers/ callees with highest cost at the top and to bottom. The Cost and Calls columns show the cost used for all calls from the function in the line above.
Flat Profile
Profile Dumps This dockable shows in the top part the list of loadable profile dumps in all subdirectories of: current working directory of KCachegrind, i. e. where it was started from, and the default profile dump directory given in the configuration. The list is sorted according to the target command profiled in the corresponding dump. On selecting a profile dump, information for it is shown in the bottom area of the dockable: Options allows you to view the profiled command and profile options of this dump. By changing any item, a new (yet unexisting) profile template is created. Press Run Profile to start a profile run with these options in the background. Info gives detailed info on the selected dump like event cost summary and properties of the simulated cache. State is only available for current happening profiles runs. Press Update to see different counters of the run, and a stack trace of the current position in the program profiled. Check the Every option to let KCachegrind regularly poll these data. Check the Sync option to let the dockable activate the top function in the current loaded dump.

& Export Graph
Export Call Graph Generates a file with extension. dot for the tools of the GraphViz package.
& Force Dump
Force Dump This forces a dump for a Callgrind profile run in the current directory. This action is checked while KCachegrind looks for the dump. If the dump is finished, it automatically reloads the current trace. If this is the one from the running Callgrind, the new created trace part will be loaded, too. Force dump creates a file'callgrind. cmd ', and checks every second for its existence. A running Callgrind will detect this file, dump a trace part, and delete'callgrind. cmd'. The deletion is detected by KCachegrind, and it does a Reload. If there is no Callgrind running, press'Force Dump 'again to cancel the dump request. This deletes'callgrind. cmd' itself and stops polling for a new dump. Note: A Callgrind run only detects existence of'callgrind. cmd 'when actively running a few milliseconds, i. e. not sleeping. Tip: For a profiled GUI program, you can awake Callgrind e. g. by resizing a window of the program.

Show percentage costs relative to parent If this is switched off, percentage costs are always shown relative to the total cost of the profile part(s) that are currently browsed. By turning on this option, percentage cost of shown cost items will be relative to the parent cost item. Cost Type Parent Cost Function Cumulative Total Function Self Function Group (*) / Total Call Function Inclusive Source Line Function Inclusive (*) Only if function grouping is switched on (e. g. ELF object grouping).
Cycle Detection
Detect recursive cycles If this is switched off, the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see documentation). The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; therefore, there is the option to switch this off.

... that the What's this... help for every GUI widget in KCachegrind contains detailed usage information for this widget? It is highly recommend to read at least these help texts on first use. Request What's this... help by pressing Shift-F1 and clicking on the widget.
... that you can get profile information at instruction level with Calltree when you provide the option --dump-instr=yes? Use the Assembler View for the instruction annotations.
... that you can use Alt-Left/ Right keys of your keyboard to go back/ forward in the active object history?
... that you can navigate in the Callee/ Caller Map View using arrow keys? Use Left/ Right to change to siblings of the current item; use Up/ Down to go one nesting level up/ down. To select the current item, press Space, and to activate it, press Return.
... that you can navigate in the Call Graph View using arrow keys? Use Up/ Down to go one calling level up/ down, alternating between calls and functions. Use Left/ Right to change to siblings of a current selected call. To activate the current item, press Return.
... that you can rapidly locate a function by entering part of its name (case-insensitive) into the edit line of the toolbar and hit return?
... that you can assign custom colors to ELF objects/ C++ Classes/ Source Files for graph coloring in Settings- > Configure KCachegrind...?
... that you can see if debug info is available for a selected function by looking at the location label in the Info tab or the source listing header in the source tab? There must be the name of the source file (with extension). If KCachegrind still does not show the source, make sure that you have added the directory of the source file to the Source Directories list in the configuration.
... that you can configure whether KCachgrind should show absolute event counts or relative ones (percentage display)?
... that you can configure the maximum number of items for all function lists in KCachegrind? Limiting the number of items is done to get a fast reacting GUI. The last item in the list will show you the number of skipped functions, together with a cost condition for these skipped functions. To activate a function with small costs, search for it and select it in the flat profile. Selecting functions with small cost will temporarily add them to the flat profile list.
... that the Coverage tab - in contrast to the Call Lists tab - shows all functions that are calling the selected function (upper part) / are called by the selected function (bottom part), no matter how many function are between them on the stack? Examples: An entry in the upper list for function foo1() with a value of 50% with function bar() selected means that 50% of all the cost of function bar() happened while called from function foo1(). An entry in the bottom list for function foo2() with a value of 50% with function bar() selected means that 50% of all the cost of function bar() happened while calling foo2() from bar().
... that waiting for the tool tip inside of a tree map shows the list of names of the nested rectangles the mouse pointer is over? Items from this list can be selected by pressing the right mouse button.
... that you can constrain the cost counts shown to only a few parts of the whole trace by selecting these parts in the "Trace Selection" Dockable? To generate multiple parts in a profiling run with cachegrind, use e. g. option --cachedumps=xxx for parts of a length of xxx basic blocks (A basic block is a run of not-branching assembler statements inside of your program code).

The Parts Overview A trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run. The Trace Part Overview dockable shows these, horizontally ordered in execution time; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts. You can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only. The parts are further subdivided: there is a partitioning and an callee split mode: Partitioning: You see the partitioning into groups for a trace part, according to the group type selected. E. g. if ELF object groups are selected, you see colored rectangles for each used ELF object (shared library or executable), sized according to the cost spent therein. Callee: A rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown. This is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees.
The Flat Profile The flat profile contains a group and a function selection list. The group list contains all groups where costs are spent in, depending on the chosen group type. The group list is hidden when group type'Function 'is selected. The function list contains the functions of the selected group (or all for'Function' group type), ordered by the costs spent therein. Functions with costs less than 1% are hidden on default.

Annotated Assembler The annotated assembler list shows the machine code instructions of the current selected function together with (self) cost spent while executing an instruction. If this is a call instruction, lines with details on the call happening are inserted into the source: the cost spent inside of the call, the number of calls happening, and the call destination. The disassembler output shown is generated with the'objdump 'utility from the'binutils' package. Select a line with call information to make the destination function of this call current.

Call Graph around active Function Depending on configuration, this view shows the call graph environment of the active function. Note: the shown cost is only the cost which is spent while the active function was actually running; i. e. the cost shown for main() - if it is visible - should be the same as the cost of the active function, as that is the part of inclusive cost of main() spent while the active function was running. For cycles, blue call arrows indicate that this is an artificial call added for correct drawing which actually never happened. If the graph is larger than the widget area, an overview panner is shown in one edge. There are similar visualization options to the Call Treemap; the selected function is highlighted.
Warning: a long lasting graph layouting is in progress. Reduce node/ edge limits for speedup.

Information Tabs This widget shows information for the current selected function in different tabs: The Costs tab shows a list of available event types and the inclusive and self costs regarding to these types. The Parts tab shows a list of trace parts if the trace consists of more than one part (otherwise, this tab is hided). The cost of the selected function spent in the different parts together with the calls happening is shown. The Call Lists tab shows direct callers and callees of the function in more detail. The Coverage tab shows the same is the Call Lists tab, but not only direct callers and callees but also indirect ones. The Call Graph tab shows a graphical visualization of the calls done by this function. The Source tab presents annotated source code if debugging information and the source file is available. The Assembler tab presents annotated assembler code if trace information on instruction level is available. For more information, see the What's this help of the corresponding tab widget
(No Data loaded)
Source (unknown)
Annotated Source The annotated source list shows the source lines of the current selected function together with (self) cost spent while executing the code of this source line. If there was a call in a source line, lines with details on the call happening are inserted into the source: the cost spent inside of the call, the number of calls happening, and the call destination. Select a inserted call information line to make the destination function current.

List of all Callers This list shows all functions calling the current selected one, either directly or with several functions in-between on the stack; the number of functions in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the selected function while a listed function is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the selected function while the listed one is active. The cost graphic shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls from the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.
List of all Callees This list shows all functions called by the current selected one, either directly or with several function in-between on the stack; the number of function in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the listed function while the selected is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the listed function while the selected one is active. The cost graphic always shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls to the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

Caller Map This graph shows the nested hierarchy of all callers of the current activated function. Each colored rectangle represents a function; its size tries to be proportional to the cost spent therein while the active function is running (however, there are drawing constrains).
Call Map This graph shows the nested hierarchy of all callees of the current activated function. Each colored rectangle represents a function; its size tries to be proportional to the cost spent therein while the active function is running (however, there are drawing constrains).
Appearance options can be found in the in the context menu. To get exact size proportions, choose'Hide incorrect borders'. As this mode can be very time consuming, you may want to limit the maximum drawn nesting level before. 'Best 'determinates the split direction for children from the aspect ratio of the parent. 'Always Best' decides on remaining space for each sibling. 'Ignore Proportions' takes space for function name drawing before drawing children. Note that size proportions can get heavily wrong. This is a TreeMap widget. Keyboard navigation is available with the left/ right arrow keys for traversing siblings, and up/ down arrow keys to go a nesting level up/ down. Return activates the current item.

List of direct Callers This list shows all functions calling the current selected one directly, together with a call count and the cost spent in the current selected function while being called from the function from the list. An icon instead of an inclusive cost specifies that this is a call inside of a recursive cycle. An inclusive cost makes no sense here. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

Trace Part List This list shows all trace parts of the loaded trace. For each part, the self/ inclusive cost of the current selected function, spent in the part, is shown; percentage costs are always relative to the total cost of the part (not to the whole trace as in the Trace Part Overview). Also shown are the calls happening to/ from the current function inside of the trace part. By choosing one or more trace parts from the list, the costs shown all over KCachegrind will only be the ones spent in the selected part(s). If no list selection is shown, in fact all trace parts are selected implicitly. This is a multi-selection list. You can select ranges by dragging the mouse or use SHIFT/ CTRL modifiers. Selection/ Deselection of trace parts can also be done by using the Trace Part Overview Dockable. This one also supports multiple selection. Note that the list is hidden if only one trace part is loaded.

Diff Program
You can select a different diff program here. On Solaris the standard diff program does not support all the options that the GNU version does. This way you can select that version.
Select the format of the output generated by diff. Unified is the one that is used most frequently because it is very readable. The KDE developers like this format the best so use it for sending patches.
Output Format
Lines of Context
The number of context lines is normally 2 or 3. This makes the diff readable and applicable in most cases. More than 3 lines will only bloat the diff unnecessarily.

A lot of good advice
Cervisia diff viewer
This will compare URL1 with URL2
This will open URL1 and expect it to be diff output. URL1 can also be a '- 'and then it will read from standard input. Can be used for instance for cvs diff _BAR_ kompare -o -. Kompare will do a check to see if it can find the original file(s) and then blend the original file(s) into the diffoutput and show that in the viewer. -n disables the check.
This will blend URL2 into URL1, URL2 is expected to be diff output and URL1 the file or folder that the diffoutput needs to be blended into.
Disables the check for automatically finding the original file(s) when using '- 'as URL with the -o option.
Use this to specify the encoding when calling it from the command line. It will default to the local encoding if not specified.

Do n't run with scissors.
Never trust car salesmen or politicians.
Real programmers do n't comment their code. It was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.
It is much easier to suggest solutions when you know nothing about the problem.
You can never have too much memory or disk space.
The answer is 42.
It's not a bug. It's a misfeature.
Help stamp out and abolish redundancy.
To maximize a window vertically, click the maximize button with the middle mouse button.
You can use Alt+Tab to switch between applications.
Press Ctrl+Esc to show the applications running in your current session.
Alt+F2 displays a small window that you can type a command into.
Ctrl+F1 to Ctrl+F8 can be used to switch virtual desktops.
You can move buttons on the panel using the middle mouse button.
Alt+F1 pops-up the system menu.
Ctrl+Alt+Esc can be used to kill an application that has stopped responding.
If you leave KDE applications open when you logout, they will be restarted automatically when you log back in.
The KDE file manager is also a web browser and an FTP client.

Comment (optional):
Custom Decryption Command: This option allows the user to specify a custom command to be executed by GPG when decryption occurs. (This is recommended for advanced users only).
Custom decryption command:
PGP 6 compatibility
PGP 6 compatibility: Checking this option forces GnuPG to output encrypted packets that are as compliant with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) 6 standards as possible thus allowing GnuPG users to inter operate with PGP 6 users.
ASCII armored encryption
ASCII armored encryption: Checking this option outputs all encrypted files in a format that can be opened by a text editor and as such the output is suitable for placing in the body of an e-mail message.
Use *. pgp extension for encrypted files
Use *. pgp extension for encrypted files: Checking this option will append a. pgp extension to all encrypted files instead of a. gpg extension. This option will maintain compatibility with users of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software.
Hide user id
Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.
Custom encryption command:
Custom encryption command: When activated, an entry field will be shown in the key selection dialog, enabling you to enter a custom command for encryption. This option is recommended for experienced users only.
Always encrypt with:
Always encrypt with: This ensures all files/ messages will also be encrypted with the chosen key. However, if the "Encrypt files with:" option is selected that chosen key will override the "Always encrypt with:" selection.
Encrypt files with:
Encrypt files with: Checking this option and selecting a key will force any file encryption operation to use the selected key. KGpg will not query for a recipient and the default key will be bypassed.
Allow encryption with untrusted keys
Allow encryption with untrusted keys: When importing a public key, the key is usually marked as untrusted and as such cannot be used unless it is signed by the default key (thus making it'trusted '). Checking this box enables any key to be used even if it is untrusted.

If this option is not checked, the clipboard will work with Key shortcuts (Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v).

Key Server: A Key Server is a centralized repository of PGP/ GnuPG keys connected to the Internet which can be conveniently accessed in order to obtain or deposit keys. Select from the drop down list to specify which key server should be used. Often these keys are held by people whom the user has never met and as such the authenticity is dubious at best. Refer to the GnuPG manual covering "Web-of-Trust" relationships to find out how GnuPG works around the problem of verifying authenticity.
Key Server Drop Down Dialog: Allows the user to select the Key Server which will be used to import PGP/ GnuPG keys into the local keyring.
Text to search or ID of the key to import: There are multiple ways to search for a key, you can use a text or partial text search (example: entering Phil or Zimmerman will bring up all keys in which Phil or Zimmerman shows up) or you can search by the ID's of the key. Key ID's are strings of letters and numbers that uniquely identify a key (example: searching for 0xED7585F4 would bring up the key associated with that ID).

If you want to decrypt a text file, simply drag and drop it into the editor window. KGpg will do the rest. Even remote files can be dropped. Drag a public key into the editor window and kgpg will automatically import it if you want.
The easiest way to encrypt a file: simply right click on the file, and you have an encrypt option in the contextual menu. This works in konqueror or on your Desktop!
If you want to encrypt a message for several persons, just select several encryption keys by pressing the & quot; Ctrlquot; key.
You do not know anything about encryption? No problem, simply create yourself a key pair in the key management window. Then, export your public key and mail it to your friends. Ask them to do the same and import their public keys. Finally, to send an encrypted message, type it in the KGpg editor, then click & quot; encryptquot;. Choose your friend key and click & quot; encryptquot; again. The message will be encrypted, ready to be sent by email.
To perform an operation on a key, open the key management window and right click on the key. A popup menu with all available options will appear.
Decrypt a file with a single mouse click on it. You will then be prompted for password, and then that is it!
If you only want to open the key manager, type this in the command line prompt: kgpg -k The editor can be reached by: kgpg -d
The number of signatures is shown as a tooltip if you hover the mouse on the size column in key manager. A key has to be expanded once for this to work.

Shred Files
You must be aware that shredding is not secure on all file systems, and that parts of the file may have been saved in a temporary file or in the spooler of your printer if you previously opened it in an editor or tried to print it. Only works on files (not on folders).
Do you really want to shred these files?
Shredder
Cannot shred folder.
KGpg Error
Process halted, not all files were shredded.
Shred source file
Shred source file: Checking this option will shred (overwrite several times before erasing) the files you have encrypted. This way, it is almost impossible that the source file is recovered. But you must be aware that this is not absolutely secure on all file systems, and that parts of the file may have been saved in a temporary file or in the spooler of your printer if you previously opened it in an editor or tried to print it. Only works on files (not on folders).
KGpg allows you to create a shredder on your desktop. It will shred (overwrite several times before erasing) the files you drop on it, making it almost impossible to recover the original file.
shredInfo
Install Shredder
Shred the source file after encryption.
Install shredder on my desktop
This will install a shredder icon on your desktop. The shredder securely deletes files (overwriting them 35 times) dropped on to it. Remember that if you download a file or open one in an editor, parts of the file may be saved in a temporary location. Shredding will not erase these temporary files. Shredding may not be 100% secure if you use a journaling file system.
Shred source file: permanently remove source file. No recovery will be possible

You have selected %1 as the encoding of the files. Selecting the correct encoding is very important as if you have files that have some other encoding than the selected one, after a replace you may damage those files. In case you do not know the encoding of your files, select utf8 and enable the creation of backup files. This setting will autodetect utf8 and utf16 files, but the changed files will be converted to utf8.

This option specifies the number of spaces Tidy uses to indent content, when indentation is enabled.
Whether to do line wrapping.
This option specifies the right margin Tidy uses for line wrapping. Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length.
This option specifies if Tidy should output tag names in upper case. The default is no, which results in lower case tag names, except for XML input, where the original case is preserved.
This option specifies if Tidy should output attribute names in upper case. The default is no, which results in lower case attribute names, except for XML input, where the original case is preserved.
This option specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy. If set to "omit" the output wo n't contain a DOCTYPE declaration. If set to "auto" (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based upon the contents of the document. If set to "strict", Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the strict DTD. If set to "loose", the DOCTYPE is set to the loose (transitional) DTD. Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal public identifier (FPI).
This option specifies if Tidy should pretty print output, writing it as well-formed XML. Any entities not defined in XML 1.0 will be written as numeric entities to allow them to be parsed by a XML parser. The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved, regardless of other options.
This option specifies if Tidy should strip out surplus presentational tags and attributes replacing them by style rules and structural markup as appropriate. It works well on the HTML saved by Microsoft Office products.
This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for both the input and output.

Crop picture to edges
Do n't export extra blank space to file
Crop picture to edges This will eliminate all blank portions of the drawing. The picture will only be as large as the stencils it contains. If your stencils are located in the upper right corner of the page, then only the upper right corner will be exported.
& Quality:
The higher the quality, the more space the file takes up
Quality Not all file formats use this. But for those that do, this affects the quality of the image that gets exported. 100 is the maximum quality. The higher the number, the better the picture looks. The downside is the higher the number, the larger the filesize.

Autocorrection
Simple Autocorrection
Convert & two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character (e. g. PErfect to Perfect)
Detect when a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is typed and provide formatting that matches the way an Internet browser would show a URL.
& Suppress double spaces
Remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
Automatically do & bold and underline formatting
When typing '1) 'or similar in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that numbering style. This has the advantage that further paragraphs will also be numbered and the spacing is done correctly.
Replace 1st... with 1^st...
When typing '* 'or '-' in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that list-style. Using a list-style formatting means that a correct bullet is used to draw the list.

& Other encoding:
& Default encoding (CP 1252)
Most Write documents are stored using this encoding (also known as windows-1252). Select this if unsure.
& Advanced
These advanced options allow you to fine-tune the importing of formatting information. They compensate for differences between KWord and MS Write by adding extra formatting information (not found in the original document), to try to make the imported document look as close to the original as possible. It is safe to use the defaults, if unsure.
Compensate for & linespacing differences
Try to simulate Write's linespacing by adding some spaces before each paragraph.

p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Actual Cost of Work Performed
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Here you define when the project shall start or end. If start time is defined, the project is scheduled forward from this time. When the project has been calculated, end time shows when the project is planned to end. If end time is defined, the project is scheduled backwards from this time. When the project has been calculated, start time shows when the project must start in order to finish in time.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Scheduling Configuration. These settings affect the actual scheduling of the task. The estimation can be either effort based or duration based. If it is effort based, the final duration will depend on the resources assigned to the task. For duration based estimation, the assigned resources do n't affect the fixed duration of the task, but only the costs.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} These values are used when you estimate the effort needed to complete a task.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.
Maximum number of tiles kept in memory:
This configures how much Krita will use the swap file. If you move the slider all the way to the left, Krita will not use the swap file at all. If you move it all the way to the right, Krita will make maximum use of the swap file.
Swappiness:
This configures how much Krita likes to swap. Move the slider to the left, and there is no swapping at all. Move it to the right there is a lot of swapping going on.

Rendering intent determines the bias in the color conversion.
Rendering Intent
Hue hopefully maintained (but not required), lightness and saturation sacrificed to maintain the perceived color. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for images.
Within and outside gamut; same as Absolute Colorimetric. White point changed to result in neutral grays.
Relative colorimetric
Hue and saturation maintained with lightness sacrificed to maintain saturation. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for business graphics (make it colorful charts, graphs, overheads,...)
Within the destination device gamut; hue, lightness and saturation are maintained. Outside the gamut; hue and lightness are maintained, saturation is sacrificed. White point for source and destination; unchanged. Intended for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...)

Colorspace Conversion
& Rendering Intent
For images
Hue hopefully maintained (but not required), lightness and saturation sacrificed to maintain the perceived color. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for images.
Within and outside gamut; same as Absolute Colorimetric. White point changed to result in neutral grays. If adequate table is present in profile, then, it is used. Else reverts to perceptual intent.
Best for graphs and charts
Hue and saturation maintained with lightness sacrificed to maintain saturation. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for business graphics (make it colorful charts, graphs, overheads,...) If adequate table is present in profile, then, it is used. Else reverts to perceptual intent.
Best for spot colours
Within the destination device gamut; hue, lightness and saturation are maintained. Outside the gamut; hue and lightness are maintained, saturation is sacrificed. White point for source and destination; unchanged. Intended for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...)

Pasting data from simple source
The image data you are trying to paste has no color profile information. On the web and in simple applications the data are supposed to be in sRGB color format. Importing as web will show it as it is supposed to look. Most monitors are not perfect though so if you made the image yourself you might want to import it as it looked on you monitor. How do you want to interpret these data?

You can select here the font style, size and color, including some additional options like underlined or stroke out text for the current cell text. The lower part of the page gives a preview of the selected text format. The default font is set for all cells in the Format - > Style Manager menu with the currently used style.
Choose the style for your font for the currently selected cells. When you select several cells with different styles, the displayed style is set to Varying (No Change) and leaving it that way will keep all your current style settings for each cell. Changing to Roman for example will change all the selected cells style text to Roman.

This tab enables you to set Cell Protection. All cells are protected by default (that means cell content cannot be changed) and for the cell protection to be active you also need to protect the sheet using the Tools - > Protect Document - > Protect Sheet... menu and to provide a password. You can also hide the cell formula in order to protect the way you calculate the formula. This also needs to enable sheet protection to work. You can hide the cell content with Hide all and again this needs sheet protection. You can learn more about all these settings in the User Manual in the Advanced KSpread chapter.
Printing
If checked, the content of the cell will not be printed. If this is not checked (default), the cell content will be printed. Note that you can print it even if the cell is protected
& Do not print text
Protection
This hides the cell content and works only when the sheet is protected. Whether the cell itself is protected or not does not matter.
Hide & all
If checked, the cell content will be protected. This is the default behavior. You need to protect the whole sheet using the Tools- > Protect document- > Protect Sheet... menu option for this individual cell protection to work. See the manual for more details in the Advanced KSpread chapter. When a cell is protected, its content cannot be changed.
& Protected
When this is checked, the cell is still visible. However, its contents do not appear in the Formula bar. Hiding formula is only working for cells that contain formulae so the user cannot view the formula. And the sheet must be protected for this to work.

& General
& Data Format

& Position
& Border
Background
& Cell Protection
This is the default format and KSpread autodetects the actual data type depending on the current cell data. By default, KSpread right justifies numbers, dates and times within a cell and left justifies anything else.
The number notation uses the notation you globally choose in KControl - > Regional & Accessibility - > Numbers tab. Numbers are right justified by default.
When you have a number in the current cell and you switch from the dcell format from Generic to Percent, the current cell number will be multiplied by 100%. For example if you enter 12 and set the cell format to Percent, the number will then be 1,200%. Switching back to Generic cell format will bring it back to 12. You can also use the Percent icon in the Format Toolbar.
The Money format converts your number into money notation using the settings globally fixed in KControl in Regional & Accessibility - > Money. The currency symbol will be displayed and the precision will be the one set in KControl. You can also use the Currency icon in the Format Toolbar to set the cell formatting to look like your current currency.
Scientific
The scientific format changes your number using the scientific notation. For example, 0.0012 will be changed to 1.2E-03. Going back using Generic cell format will display 0.0012 again.
The fraction format changes your number into a fraction. For example, 0.1 can be changed to 1/ 8, 2/ 16, 1/ 10, etc. You define the type of fraction by choosing it in the field on the right. If the exact fraction is not possible in the fraction mode you choose, the nearest closest match is chosen. For example: when we have 1.5 as number, we choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 the text displayed into cell is "1 8/ 16" which is an exact fraction. If you have 1.4 as number in your cell and you choose Fraction and Sixteenths 1/ 16 then the cell will display "1 6/ 16" which is the nearest closest Sixteenth fraction.
To enter a date, you should enter it in one of the formats set in KControl in Regional & Accessibility - > Time & Dates. There are two formats set here: the date format and the short date format. Just like you can drag down numbers you can also drag down dates and the next cells will also get dates.
This formats your cell content as a time. To enter a time, you should enter it in the Time format set in KControl in Regional & Accessibility - > Time & Dates. In the Cell Format dialog box you can set how the time should be displayed by choosing one of the available time format options. The default format is the system format set in KControl. When the number in the cell does not make sense as a time, KSpread will display 00:00 in the global format you have in KControl.
This formats your cell content as date and time. To enter a date and a time, you should enter it in the Time format set in KControl in Regional & Accessibility - > Time & Dates. In the Cell Format dialog box you can set how the time should be displayed by choosing one of the available date format options. The default format is the system format set in KControl. When the number in the cell does not make sense as a date and time, KSpread will display 00:00 in the global format you have in KControl.
This formats your cell content as text. This can be useful if you want a number treated as text instead as a number, for example for a ZIP code. Setting a number as text format will left justify it. When numbers are formatted as text, they cannot be used in calculations or formulas. It also change the way the cell is justified.
Custom
The custom format does not work yet. To be enabled in the next release.
This will display a preview of your choice so you can know what it does before clicking the OK button to validate it.
Displays choices of format for the fraction, date or time formats.
You can add here a Postfix such as a $HK symbol to the end of each cell content in the checked format.
variable
You can control how many digits are displayed after the decimal point for numeric values. This can also be changed using the Increase precision or Decrease precision icons in the Format toolbar.
You can add here a Prefix such as a $symbol at the start of each cell content in the checked format.
You can choose whether positive values are displayed with a leading + sign and whether negative values are shown in red.

Insert the series vertically, one below the other
Insert the series horizontally, from left to right
Type
Linear (2,4,6,...)
Generate a series from'start 'to'end' and for each step add the value provided in step. This creates a series where each value is'step 'larger than the value before it.
Geometric (2,4,8,...)
Generate a series from'start 'to'end' and for each step multiply the value with the value provided in step. Using a step of 5 produces a list like: 5, 25, 125, 625 since 5 multiplied by 5 (step) equals 25, and that multiplied by 5 equals 125, which multiplied by the same step-value of 5 equals 625.
Start value:
Stop value:
Step value:
End and start value must be positive.
End value must be greater than the start value or the step must be less than '1 '.
None of the Start, Stop or Step values may be equal to zero.
Step value must be different from 1
Step is negative.
The step value must be greater than zero; otherwise, the linear series is infinite.
If the start value is greater than the end value the step must be less than zero.
If the step is negative, the start value must be greater then the end value.

Server name (ServerName) The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server used by clients, see the client. conf file. ex: myhost. domain. com
Server administrator (ServerAdmin) The email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default CUPS will use "root@hostname". ex: root@myhost. com
Access log (AccessLog) The access log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ access_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log
Data directory (DataDir) The root directory for the CUPS data files. By default / usr/ share/ cups. ex: / usr/ share/ cups
Default character set (DefaultCharset) The default character set to use. If not specified, defaults to utf-8. Note that this can also be overridden in HTML documents... ex: utf-8
Default language (DefaultLanguage) The default language if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used. ex: en
Document directory (DocumentRoot) The root directory for HTTP documents that are served. By default the compiled-in directory. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Error log (ErrorLog) The error log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ error_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
Font path (FontPath) The path to locate all font files (currently only for pstoraster). By default / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts
Log level (LogLevel) Controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog file and can be one of the following: debug2: Log everything. debug: Log almost everything. info: Log all requests and state changes. warn: Log errors and warnings. error: Log only errors. none: Log nothing. ex: info
Max log size (MaxLogSize) Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1MB). Set to 0 to disable log rotating. ex: 1048576
Page log (PageLog) The page log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ page_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Preserve job history (PreserveJobHistory) Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is Yes. ex: Yes
Preserve job files (PreserveJobFiles) Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is No. ex: No
Printcap file (Printcap) The name of the printcap file. Default is no filename. Leave blank to disable printcap file generation. ex: / etc/ printcap
Request directory (RequestRoot) The directory where request files are stored. By default / var/ spool/ cups. ex: / var/ spool/ cups

Server binaries (ServerBin) The root directory for the scheduler executables. By default / usr/ lib/ cups or / usr/ lib32/ cups (IRIX 6.5). ex: / usr/ lib/ cups
Server files (ServerRoot) The root directory for the scheduler. By default / etc/ cups. ex: / etc/ cups
User (User) The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user as needed. Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run... ex: lp
Group (Group) The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed. ex: sys
RIP cache (RIPCache) The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number followed by "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles (1 tile = 256x256 pixels). Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes). ex: 8m
Temporary files (TempDir) The directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be writable by the user defined above! Defaults to "/ var/ spool/ cups/ tmp" or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable. ex: / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp
Filter limit (FilterLimit) Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited). ex: 200
Listen to (Port/ Listen) Ports/ addresses that are listened to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what is used here. You can have multiple Port/ Listen lines to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access. Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...). ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631
Hostname lookups (HostNameLookups) Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to Off for performance reasons... ex: On
Keep alive (KeepAlive) Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. Default is on. ex: On
Keep-alive timeout (KeepAliveTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. Default is 60 seconds. ex: 60
Max clients (MaxClients) Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100. ex: 100
Max request size (MaxRequestSize) Controls the maximum size of HTTP requests and print files. Set to 0 to disable this feature (defaults to 0). ex: 0
Client timeout (Timeout) The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. Default is 300 seconds. ex: 300
Use browsing (Browsing) Whether or not to listen to printer information from other CUPS servers. Enabled by default. Note: to enable the sending of browsing information from this CUPS server to the LAN, specify a valid BrowseAddress. ex: On
Use short names (BrowseShortNames) Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e. g. "printer" instead of "printer@host"). Enabled by default. ex: Yes
Browse addresses (BrowseAddress) Specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces. Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i. e. no CIDR support). ex: x. y. z.255, x. y.255.255
Browse allow/ deny (BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny) BrowseAllow: specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses. BrowseDeny: specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses. Both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" accept the following notations for addresses: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The hostname/ domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname lookups on!
Browse interval (BrowseInterval) The time between browsing updates in seconds. Default is 30 seconds. Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates. Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts. ex: 30
Browse order (BrowseOrder) Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny comparisons. ex: allow, deny
Browse poll (BrowsePoll) Poll the named server(s) for printers. ex: myhost:631
Browse port (BrowsePort) The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized. ex: 631
Browse relay (BrowseRelay) Relay browser packets from one address/ network to another. ex: src-address dest-address
Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list. This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds. ex: 300
Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses) Whether or not to use implicit classes. Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both. When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e. g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue. Enabled by default.
System group (SystemGroup) The group name for "System" (printer administration) access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system, or root (checked for in that order). ex: sys
Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate) The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt
Encryption key (ServerKey) The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Access permissions # Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot... # AuthType: the authorization to use: # None - Perform no authentication Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. # (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface) # AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported. # AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization. # Order: the order of Allow/ Deny processing. # Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses: # All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm # The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above. # Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. # Possible values: # Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it # The default value is "IfRequested".
Authentication (AuthType) The authorization to use: None - Perform no authentication. Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface.
Class (AuthClass) The authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
The user/ group names allowed to access the resource. The format is a comma separated list.
Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".
Authentication group name (AuthGroupName) The group name for Group authorization.
ACL order (Order) The order of Allow/ Deny processing.
Allow Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
ACL addresses (Allow/ Deny) Allows/ Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
Encryption (Encryption) Whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. Possible values: Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it The default value is "IfRequested".
Access permissions Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
Auto purge jobs (AutoPurgeJobs) Automatically purge jobs when not needed for quotas. Default is No.
Browse protocols (BrowseProtocols) Which protocols to use for browsing. Can be any of the following separated by whitespace and/ or commas: all - Use all supported protocols. cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol. slp - Use the SLPv2 protocol. The default is cups. Note: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is strongly recommended that you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your network. Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds, during which the scheduler will not response to client requests.
Classification (Classification) The classification level of the server. If set, this classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled. The default is the empty string. ex: confidential
Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride) Whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners. The default is off.
Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers) Whether or not to show the members of an implicit class. When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class. Enabled by default.
Use & quot; anyquot; classes (ImplicitAnyClasses) Whether or not to create AnyPrinter implicit classes. When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name exists, e. g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead. When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created when there is a local queue of the same name. Disabled by default.
Max jobs (MaxJobs) Maximum number of jobs to keep in memory (active and completed). Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per user (MaxJobsPerUser) The MaxJobsPerUser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user. Once a user reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per printer (MaxJobsPerPrinter) The MaxJobsPerPrinter directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each printer or class. Once a printer or class reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Port The port value that the CUPS daemon is listening to. Default is 631.
Address The address that the CUPS daemon is listening at. Leave it empty or use an asterisk (*) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork.
Check this box if you want to use SSL encryption with this address/ port.

KDE Printing Management
(c) 2000 - 2002 Michael Goffioul
Michael Goffioul
Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

Selecting this option causes the taskbar to display a button that, when clicked, shows a list of all windows in a popup menu.
Show only minimized windows
Select this option if you want the taskbar to display only minimized windows. By default, this option is not selected and the taskbar will show all windows.
& Group similar tasks:
The taskbar can group similar windows into single buttons. When one of these window group buttons are clicked on a menu appears showing all the windows in that group. This can be especially useful with the Show all windows option. You can set the taskbar to Never group windows, to Always group windows or to group windows only When the Taskbar is Full. By default the taskbar groups windows when it is full.

Printcap Entry: %1
Printer Location: The Location may describe where the selected printer is located. The Location description is created by the administrator of the print system (or may be left empty).
Printer Type: The Type indicates your printer type.
Printer State: The State indicates the state of the print queue on the print server (which could be your localhost). The state may be'Idle ', 'Processing', 'Stopped ', 'Paused' or similar.
Printer Comment: The Comment may describe the selected printer. This comment is created by the administrator of the print system (or may be left empty).
Printer Selection Menu: Use this combo box to select the printer to which you want to print. Initially (if you run KDEPrint for the first time), you may only find the KDE special printers (which save jobs to disk [as PostScript- or PDF-files], or deliver jobs via email (as a PDF attachment). If you are missing a real printer, you need to...... either create a local printer with the help of the KDE Add Printer Wizard. The Wizard is available for the CUPS and RLPR printing systems (click button to the left of the'Properties' button),... or try to connect to an existing remote CUPS print server. You can connect by clicking the'System Options' button below. A new dialog opens: click on the'CUPS server 'icon: Fill in the information required to use the remote server. Note: It may happen that you successfully connected to a remote CUPS server and still do not get a printer list. If this happens: force KDEPrint to re-load its configuration files. To reload the configuration files, either start kprinter again, or switch the print system away from CUPS and back again once. The print system switch can be made through a selection in the drop-down menu at bottom of this dialog when fully expanded).
Print Job Properties: This button opens a dialog where you can make decisions regarding all supported print job options.
Selective View on List of Printers: This button reduces the list of visible printers to a shorter, more convenient, pre-defined list. This is particularly useful in enterprise environments with lots of printers. The default is to show all printers. To create a personal'selective view list ', click on the'System Options' button at the bottom of this dialog. Then, in the new dialog, select'Filter '(left column in the KDE Print Configuration dialog) and setup your selection. Warning: Clicking this button without prior creation of a personal'selective view list' will make all printers dissappear from the view. (To re-enable all printers, just click this button again.)
KDE Add Printer Wizard This button starts the KDE Add Printer Wizard. Use the Wizard (with "CUPS" or "RLPR") to add locally defined printers to your system. Note: The KDE Add Printer Wizard does not work, and this button is disabled if you use "Generic LPD", "LPRng", or "Print Through an External Program".)
External Print Command Here you can enter any command that would also print for you in a konsole window. Example: a2ps -P & lt; printernamegt; --medium=A3.
Additional Print Job Options This button shows or hides additional printing options.
System Options: This button starts a new dialog where you can adjust various settings of your printing system. Amongst them: Should KDE applications embed all fonts into the PostScript they generate for printing? Should KDE use an external PostScript viewer like gv for print page previews? Should KDEPrint use a local or a remote CUPS server?, and many more....
Help: This button takes you to the complete KDEPrint Manual.
Cancel: This button cancels your print job and quits the kprinter dialog.
Print: This button sends the job to the printing process. If you are sending non-PostScript files, you may be asked if you want KDE to convert the files into PostScript, or if you want your print subsystem (like CUPS) to do this.
Keep Printing Dialog Open If you enable this checkbox, the printing dialog stays open after you hit the Print button. This is especially useful, if you need to test various print settings (like color matching for an inkjet printer) or if you want to send your job to multiple printers (one after the other) to have it finished more quickly.
Output File Name and Path: The "Output file:" shows you where your file will be saved if you decide to "Print to File" your job, using one of the KDE Special Printers named "Print to File (PostScript)" or "Print to File (PDF)". Choose a name and location that suits your need by using the button and/ or editing the line on the right.
Output File Name and Path: Edit this line to create a path and filename that suits your needs. (Button and Lineedit field are only available if you "Print to File")
Browse Directories button: This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to let you choose a directory and file name where your "Print-to-File" job should be saved.
Add File to Job This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to allow you to select a file for printing. Note, that you can select ASCII or International Text, PDF, PostScript, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF and many other graphical formats. you can select various files from different paths and send them as one "multi-file job" to the printing system.
Print Preview Enable this checkbox if you want to see a preview of your printout. A preview lets you check if, for instance, your intended "poster" or "pamphlet" layout looks like you expected, without wasting paper first. It also lets you cancel the job if something looks wrong. Note: The preview feature (and therefore this checkbox) is only visible for printjobs created from inside KDE applications. If you start kprinter from the commandline, or if you use kprinter as a print command for non-KDE applications (like Acrobat Reader, Firefox or OpenOffice), print preview is not available here.
Set as Default Printer This button sets the current printer as the user's default. Note: (Button is only visible if the checkbox for System Options -- > General -- > Miscellaneous: "Defaults to the last printer used in the application" is disabled.)

Print Job Billing and Accounting Insert a meaningful string here to associate the current print job with a certain account. This string will appear in the CUPS "page_log" to help with the print accounting in your organization. (Leave it empty if you do not need it.) It is useful for people who print on behalf of different "customers", like print service bureaux, letter shops, press and prepress companies, or secretaries who serve different bosses, etc. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-billing=... # example: "Marketing_Department" or "Joe_Doe"
Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-hold-until=... # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"
Page Labels Page Labels are printed by CUPS at the top and bottom of each page. They appear on the pages surrounded by a little frame box. They contain any string you type into the line edit field. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-label= "..." # example: "Company Confidential"
Job Priority Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: First In, First Out. The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs. It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your own jobs.) Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-priority=... # example: "10" or "66" or "99"

Characters Per Inch This setting controls the horizontal size of characters when printing a text file. The default value is 10, meaning that the font is scaled in a way that 10 characters per inch will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o cpi=... # example: "8" or "12"
Lines Per Inch This setting controls the vertical size of characters when printing a text file. The default value is 6, meaning that the font is scaled in a way that 6 lines per inch will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o lpi=... # example "5" or "7"
Columns This setting controls how many columns of text will be printed on each page when printing text files. The default value is 1, meaning that only one column of text per page will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o columns=... # example: "2" or "4"
Preview icon changes when you turn on or off prettyprint.
Text Formats These settings control the appearance of text on printouts. They are only valid for printing text files or input directly through kprinter. Note: These settings have no effect whatsoever for input formats other than text, or for printing from applications such as the KDE Advanced Text Editor. (Applications in general send PostScript to the print system, and'kate 'in particular has its own knobs to control the print output.). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o cpi=... # example: "8" or "12" -o lpi=... # example: "5" or "7" -o columns=... # example: "2" or "4"
Margins These settings control the margins of printouts on the paper. They are not valid for jobs originating from applications that define their own page layout internally and send PostScript to KDEPrint (such as KOffice or OpenOffice. org). When printing from KDE applications, such as KMail and Konqueror, or printing an ASCII text file through kprinter, you can choose your preferred margin settings here. Margins may be set individually for each edge of the paper. The combo box at the bottom lets you change the units of measurement between Pixels, Millimeters, Centimeters, and Inches. You can even use the mouse to grab one margin and drag it to the intended position (see the preview picture on the right side). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # example: "72" -o page-bottom=... # example: "24" -o page-left=... # example: "36" -o page-right=... # example: "12"
Turn Text Printing with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) On. ASCII text file printouts can be'prettyfied 'by enabling this option. If you do so, a header is printed at the top of each page. The header contains the page number, job title (usually the filename), and the date. In addition, C and C++ keywords are highlighted, and comment lines are italicized. This prettyprint option is handled by CUPS. If you prefer another'plaintext-to-prettyprint' converter, look for the enscript pre-filter on the Filters tab. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o prettyprint=true.
Turn Text Printing with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) Off. ASCII text file printed with this option turned off appear without a page header and without syntax highlighting. (You can still set the page margins, though.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o prettyprint=false

'Use any current or future standard CUPS job option 'is not supported by the KDEPrint GUI. Control any custom job option you may want to support using custom CUPS filters and backends plugged into the CUPS filtering chain. Send short messages to the operators of your production printers in your Central Repro Department. Standard CUPS job options: A complete list of standard CUPS job options is in the CUPS User Manual. Mappings of the kprinter user interface widgets to respective CUPS job option names are provided in the various What's This help items. Custom CUPS job options: CUPS print servers may be customized with additional print filters and backends which understand custom job options. You can specify such custom job options here. If in doubt, ask your system administrator. Operator Messages: You may send additional messages to the operator(s) of your production printers (e. g. in your Central Repro Department). Messages can be read by the operator(s) (or yourself) by viewing the "Job IPP Report" for the job. Examples: A standard CUPS job option: (Name) number-up -- (Value) 9 A job option for custom CUPS filters or backends: (Name) DANKA_watermark -- (Value) Company_Confidential A message to the operator(s): (Name) Deliver_after_completion -- (Value) to_Marketing_Departm. Note: the fields must not include spaces, tabs or quotes. You may need to double-click on a field to edit it. Warning: Do not use CUPS options that can also be controlled through the KDEPrint GUI. Results may be unpredictable if the options conflict, or if they are sent multiple times. For all options supported by the GUI, please use the GUI. (Each GUI element's'What's This' names the related CUPS option name.)

Print queue on remote CUPS server Use this for a print queue installed on a remote machine running a CUPS server. This allows to use remote printers when CUPS browsing is turned off.
Network IPP printer Use this for a network-enabled printer using the IPP protocol. Modern high-end printers can use this mode. Use this mode instead of TCP if your printer can do both.
Fax/ Modem printer Use this for a fax/ modem printer. This requires the installation of the fax4CUPS backend. Documents sent on this printer will be faxed to the given target fax number.
Other printer Use this for any printer type. To use this option, you must know the URI of the printer you want to install. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about the printer URI. This option is mainly useful for printer types using 3rd party backends not covered by the other possibilities.
Class of printers Use this to create a class of printers. When sending a document to a class, the document is actually sent to the first available (idle) printer in the class. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about class of printers.

Print in Black Only (Blackplot) The'blackplot 'option specifies that all pens should plot in black-only: The default is to use the colors defined in the plot file, or the standard pen colors defined in the HP-GL/ 2 reference manual from Hewlett Packard. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o blackplot=true
Scale Print Image to Page Size The'fitplot 'option specifies that the HP-GL image should be scaled to fill exactly the page with the (elsewhere selected) media size. The default is'fitplot is disabled'. The default will therefore use the absolute distances specified in the plot file. (You should be aware that HP-GL files are very often CAD drawings intended for large format plotters. On standard office printers they will therefore lead to the drawing printout being spread across multiple pages.) Note: This feature depends upon an accurate plot size (PS) command in the HP-GL/ 2 file. If no plot size is given in the file the filter converting the HP-GL to PostScript assumes the plot is ANSI E size. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o fitplot=true
Set Pen Width for HP-GL (if not defined in file). The pen width value can be set here in case the original HP-GL file does not have it set. The pen width specifies the value in micrometers. The default value of 1000 produces lines that are 1000 micrometers == 1 millimeter in width. Specifying a pen width of 0 produces lines that are exactly 1 pixel wide. Note: The pen width option set here is ignored if the pen widths are set inside the plot file itself. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o penwidth=... # example: "2000" or "500"
HP-GL Print Options All options on this page are only applicable if you use KDEPrint to send HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 files to one of your printers. HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 are page description languages developed by Hewlett-Packard to drive Pen Plotting devices. KDEPrint can (with the help of CUPS) convert the HP-GL file format and print it on any installed printer. Note 1: To print HP-GL files, start'kprinter 'and simply load the file into the running kprinter. Note 2: The'fitplot' parameter provided on this dialog also works for printing PDF files (if your CUPS version is more recent than 1.1.22.) Additional hint for power users: These KDEPrint GUI elements correspond to the CUPS command line job option parameters: -o blackplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o fitplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o penwidth=... # examples: "true" or "false"

Brightness: Slider to control the brightness value of all colors used. The brightness value can range from 0 to 200. Values greater than 100 will lighten the print. Values less than 100 will darken the print. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o brightness=... # use range from "0" to "200"
Hue (Tint): Slider to control the hue value for color rotation. The hue value is a number from -360 to 360 and represents the color hue rotation. The following table summarizes the change you will see for the base colors: Original hue=-45 hue=45 Red Purple Yellow-orange Green Yellow-green Blue-green Yellow Orange Green-yellow Blue Sky-blue Purple Magenta Indigo Crimson Cyan Blue-green Light-navy-blue Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o hue=... # use range from "-360" to "360"
Saturation: Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used. The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image, similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers, a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers, a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o saturation=... # use range from "0" to "200"
Gamma: Slider to control the gamma value for color correction. The gamma value can range from 1 to 3000. A gamma value greater than 1000 lightens the print. A gamma value less than 1000 darkens the print. The default gamma is 1000. Note: the gamma value adjustment is not visible in the thumbnail preview. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o gamma=... # use range from "1" to "3000"
Image Printing Options All options controlled on this page only apply to printing images. Most image file formats are supported. To name a few: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, PNM (PBM/ PGM/ PNM/ PPM), Sun Raster, SGI RGB, Windows BMP. Options to influence color output of image printouts are: Brightness Hue Saturation Gamma For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the'What's This' items provided for these controls.
Coloration Preview Thumbnail The coloration preview thumbnail indicates change of image coloration by different settings. Options to influence output are: Brightness Hue (Tint) Saturation Gamma For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the'What's This' items provided for these controls.
Image Size: Drop-down menu to control the image size on the printed paper. The menu works in conjunction with slider below. The options are: Natural Image Size: Image prints in its natural image size. If it does not fit onto one sheet, the printout will be spread across multiple sheets. Note, that the slider is disabled when selecting'natural image size 'in the dropdown menu. Resolution (ppi): The resolution value slider covers a number range from 1 to 1200. It specifies the resolution of the image in Pixels Per Inch (PPI). An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print 10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example, but 5x4 inches at 600 pixels per inch. If the specified resolution makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Resolution defaults to 72 ppi.% of Page Size: The percent value slider covers numbers from 1 to 800. It specifies the size in relation to the page (not the image). A scaling of 100 percent will fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows (doing auto-rotation of the image as needed). A scaling of more than 100 will print the image across multiple sheets. A scaling of 200 percent will print on up to 4 pages. Scaling in% of page size defaults to 100%.% of Natural Image Size: The percent value slider moves from 1 to 800. It specifies the printout size in relation to the natural image size. A scaling of 100 percent will print the image at its natural size, while a scaling of 50 percent will print the image at half its natural size. If the specified scaling makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Scaling in% of natural image size defaults to 100%. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o natural-scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o ppi=... # range in ppi is 1... 1200
Position Preview Thumbnail This position preview thumbnail indicates the position of the image on the paper sheet. Click on horizontal and vertical radio buttons to move image alignment on paper around. Options are: center top top-left left bottom-left bottom bottom-right right top-right
Reset to Default Values Reset all coloration settings to default values. Default values are: Brightness: 100 Hue (Tint). 0 Saturation: 100 Gamma: 1000
Image Positioning: Select a pair of radio buttons to move the image to the position you want on the paper printout. Default is'center '. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o position=... # examples: "top-left" or "bottom"

These options will automatically put fonts in the PostScript file which are not present on the printer. Font embedding usually produces better print results (closer to what you see on the screen), but larger print data as well.
When using font embedding you can select additional directories where KDE should search for embeddable font files. By default, the X server font path is used, so adding those directories is not needed. The default search path should be sufficient in most cases.

An identification string. Use only alphanumeric characters except spaces. The string __root__ is reserved for internal use.
A description string. This string is shown in the interface, and should be explicit enough about the role of the corresponding option.
The type of the option. This determines how the option is presented graphically to the user.
The format of the option. This determines how the option is formatted for inclusion in the global command line. The tag %value can be used to represent the user selection. This tag will be replaced at run-time by a string representation of the option value.
The default value of the option. For non persistent options, nothing is added to the command line if the option has that default value. If this value does not correspond to the actual default value of the underlying utility, make the option persistent to avoid unwanted effects.
Make the option persistent. A persistent option is always written to the command line, whatever its value. This is useful when the chosen default value does not match with the actual default value of the underlying utility.
The full command line to execute the associated underlying utility. This command line is based on a mechanism of tags that are replaced at run-time. The supported tags are: %filterargs: command options %filterinput: input specification %filteroutput: output specification %psu: the page size in upper case %psl: the page size in lower case
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from a file. Use the tag %in to represent the input filename.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to a file. Use the tag %out to represent the output filename.
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from its standard input.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to its standard output.
A comment about the underlying utility, which can be viewed by the user from the interface. This comment string supports basic HTML tags like & lt; agt;, & lt; bgt; or & lt; igt;.

Configuring %1
Add File button This button calls the'File Open 'dialog to let you select a file for printing. Note, that you can select ASCII or International Text, PDF, PostScript, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF and many other graphic formats. you can select various files from different paths and send them as one "multi-file job" to the printing system.
Remove File button This button removes the highlighted file from the list of to-be-printed files.
Move File Up button This button moves the highlighted file up in the list of files to be printed. In effect, this changes the order of the files' printout.
Move File Down button This button moves the highlighted file down in the list of files to be printed. In effect, this changes the order of the files' printout.
File Open button This button tries to open the highlighted file, so you can view or edit it before you send it to the printing system. If you open files, KDEPrint will use the application matching the MIME type of the file.
File List view This list displays all the files you selected for printing. You can see the file name(s), file path(s) and the file (MIME) type(s) as determined by KDEPrint. You may re-arrange the initial order of the list with the help of the arrow buttons on the right. The files will be printed as a single job, in the same order as displayed in the list. Note: You can select multiple files. The files may be in multiple locations. The files may be of multiple MIME types. The buttons on the right side let you add more files, remove already selected files from the list, re-order the list (by moving files up or down), and open files. If you open files, KDEPrint will use the application matching the MIME type of the file.

"General" This dialog page contains general print job settings. General settings are applicable to most printers, most jobs and most job file types. To get more specific help, enable the "What's This" cursor and click on any of the text labels or GUI elements of this dialog.
Page size: Select paper size to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element correponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o PageSize=... # examples: "A4" or "Letter"
Paper type: Select paper type to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o MediaType=... # example: "Transparency"
Paper source: Select paper source tray for the paper to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o InputSlot=... # examples: "Lower" or "LargeCapacity"
Image Orientation: Orientation of the printed page image on your paper is controlled by the radio buttons. By default, the orientation is Portrait. You can select from 4 alternatives: Portrait. Portrait is the default setting. Landscape. Reverse Landscape. Reverse Landscape prints the images upside down. Reverse Portrait. Reverse Portrait prints the image upside down. The icon changes according to your selection. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o orientation-requested=... # examples: "landscape" or "reverse-portrait"
Duplex Printing: These controls may be grayed out if your printer does not support duplex printing (i. e. printing on both sides of the sheet.) These controls are active if your printer supports duplex printing. You can choose from 3 alternatives: None. This prints each page of the job on one side of the sheets only. Long Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job in a way so that the backside has the same orientation as the front side if you fold the paper over the long edge. (Some printer drivers call this mode duplex-non-tumbled.) Short Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job so that the backside has the reverse orientation from the front side if you turn the paper over the long edge, but the same orientation, if you turn it over the short edge. (Some printer drivers name this mode duplex-tumbled.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o duplex=... # examples: "tumble" or "two-sided-short-edge"
Banner Page(s): Select banner(s) to print one or two special sheets of paper just before or after your main job. Banners may contain some pieces of job information such as user name, time of printing or job title. Banner pages are useful to separate different jobs more easily, especially in a multi-user environment. Hint: You can design your own banner pages. To make use of them, just put the banner file into the standard CUPS banners directory (this is usually "/ usr/ share/ cups/ banner/". Your custom banner(s) must have one of the supported printable formats. Supported formats are ASCII text, PostScript, PDF and nearly any image format such as PNG, JPEG or GIF. Your added banner pages will appear in the drop down menu CUPS is restarted. CUPS comes with a selection of banner pages. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-sheets=... # examples: "standard" or "topsecret"
Pages per Sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. However, some printers are independently capable of printing multiple pages per sheet. In which case you find the option in the printer driver settings. Be careful: if you enable multiple pages per sheet in both places, your printout will not look as you intended. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o number-up=... # examples: "2" or "4"

Page Selection Here you can control if you print a certain selection only out of all the pages from the complete document.
All Pages: Select "All" to print the complete document. Since this is the default, it is pre-selected.
Current Page: Select "Current" if you want to print the page currently visible in your KDE application. Note: this field is disabled if you print from non-KDE applications like Mozilla or OpenOffice. org, since here KDEPrint has no means to determine which document page you are currently viewing.
Page Range: Choose a "Page Range" to select a subset of the complete document pages to be printed. The format is "n, m, o-p, q, r, s-t, u". Example: "4,6,10-13,17,20,23-25" will print the pages 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25 of your document. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-ranges=... # example: "4,6,10-13,17,20,23-25"
Page Set: Choose "All Pages", "Even Pages" or "Odd Pages" if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms. The default is "All Pages". Note: If you combine a selection of a "Page Range" with a "Page Set" of "Odd" or "Even", you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range. This is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex-only printer. In this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice; in the first pass, select "Odd" or "Even" (depending on your printer model), in second pass select the other option. You may need to "Reverse" the output in one of the passes (depending on your printer model). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-set=... # example: "odd" or "even"
Output Settings: Here you can determine the number of copies, the output order and the collate mode for the pages of your print job. (Note, that the maximum number of copies allowed to print may be restricted by your print subsystem.) The'Copies' setting defaults to 1. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o copies=... # examples: "5" or "42" -o outputorder=... # example: "reverse" -o Collate=... # example: "true" or "false".
Number of Copies: Determine the number of requested copies here. You can increase or decrease the number of printed copies by clicking on the up and down arrows. You can also type the figure directly into the box. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o copies=... # examples: "5" or "42"
Collate Copies If the "Collate" checkbox is enabled (default), the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "1-2-3-..., 1-2-3-..., 1-2-3-...". If the "Collate" checkbox is disabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "1-1-1-..., 2-2-2-..., 3-3-3-...". Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o Collate=... # example: "true" or "false"
Reverse Order If the "Reverse" checkbox is enabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "... -3-2-1,... -3-2-1,... -3-2-1", if you also have en abled the "Collate" checkbox at the same time (the usual scenario). If the "Reverse" checkbox is enabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "... -3-3-3,... -2-2-2,... -1-1-1", if you have dis abled the "Collate" checkbox at the same time. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS commandline job option parameter: -o outputorder=... # example: "reverse"

Top Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the top margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Bottom Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the bottom margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-bottom=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Left Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the left margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-left=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Right Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the right margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-right=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Change Measurement Unit. You can change the units of measurement for the page margins here. Select from Millimeters, Centimeters, Inches or Pixels (1 pixel == 1/ 72 inch.)
Custom Margins Checkbox. Enable this checkbox if you want to modify the margins of your printouts. You can change margin settings in 4 ways: Edit the text fields. Click spinbox arrows. Move the scroll wheel of a wheel mouse. Use the mouse to drag margins in the preview frame. Note: The margin setting does not work if you load files into kprinter which have their margins hardcoded internally, such as most PDF or PostScript files. It works for all ASCII text files however. It also may not work with non-KDE applications which fail to fully utilize the KDEPrint framework, such as OpenOffice. org.

You are about to set a pseudo-printer as your personal default. This setting is specific to KDE and will not be available outside KDE applications. Note that this will only make your personal default printer as undefined for non-KDE applications and should not prevent you from printing normally. Do you really want to set %1 as your personal default?

Print Poster (enabled or disabled). If you enable this option, you can print posters of different sizes The printout will happen in the form'tiles' printed on smaller paper sizes, which you can stitch together later. If you enable this option here, the'Poster Printing 'filter will be auto-loaded in the'Filters' tab of this dialog. This tab is only visible if the external'poster 'utility is discovered by KDEPrint on your system. ['poster' is a command line utility that enables you to convert PostScript files into tiled printouts, with overlap to allow the tiles to be joined together seamlessly.] Note: The standard version of'poster 'will not work. Your system must use a patched version of'poster'. Ask your operating system vendor to provide a patched version of'poster 'if they do not do so already. Additional hint for power users: A patched version of'poster' is available from the KDEPrint Website at http: / /printing. kde. org/ downloads/. The direct link to the patched source tarball is ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ printing/ poster. tar. bz2
Tile Selection widget This GUI element is not only for viewing your selections: it also lets you interactively select the tile(s) you want to print. Hints Click any tile to select it for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, 'shift-click 'on the tiles ('shift-click' means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) Be aware that the order of your clicking dictates the order in which the different tiles are printed. Note 1: The order of your selection (and the order for printout of the tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field below, labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed): 'Note 2: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Poster Size Select the poster size you want from the drop-down list. Available sizes are all standard paper sizes up to'A0 '. [A0 is the same size as 16 sheets of A4, or '84cm x 118.2cm'.] Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of poster size. It indicates to you how many tiles need to be printed to make the poster, given the selected paper size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click 'on the tiles ('shift-click' means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and of the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed): 'Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Paper Size This field indicates the paper size the poster tiles will be printed on. To select a different paper size for your poster tiles, go to the'General 'tab of this dialog and select one from the drop-down list. Available sizes are most standard paper sizes supported by your printer. Your printer's supported paper sizes are read from the printer driver info (as laid down in the'PPD', the printer description file.) Be aware that the'Paper Size 'selected may not be supported by'poster' (example: 'HalfLetter ') while it may well be supported by your printer. If you hit that obstacle, simply use another, supported Paper Size, such as'A4' or'Letter '. Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of paper size. It indicates how many tiles need to be printed to make up the poster, given the selected paper and poster size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click' on the tiles ('shift-click 'means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and for the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed):' Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Cut Margin selection This slider and spinbox let you determine a'cut margin 'to be printed onto each tile of your poster, to help you cut the pieces as needed. Notice, how the little preview window above changes with your change of cut margins. It indicates to you how much space the cut margins will take away from each tile. Be aware, that your cut margins need to be equal to or greater than the margins your printer uses. The printer's capabilities are described in the'ImageableArea' keywords of its driver PPD file.
Order and number of tile pages to be printed. This field displays and sets the individual tiles to be printed, as well as the order for their printout. You can fill the field with 2 different methods: either use the interactive thumbnail preview above and '[SHIFT]-click 'on the tiles; or, edit this text field accordingly. When editing the field, you can denote ranges of pages with, for instance, '3-7', rather than '3,4,5,6,7 '. Examples: "2,3,7,9,3" "1-3,6,8-11"

Add Filter button This button calls a little dialog to let you select a filter here. Note 1: You can chain different filters as long as you make sure that the output of one fits as input of the next. (KDEPrint checks your filtering chain and will warn you if you fail to do so). Note 2: The filters you define here are applied to your jobfile before it is handed downstream to your spooler and print subsystem (e. g. CUPS, LPRng, LPD.)
Remove Filter button This button removes the highlighted filter from the list of filters.
Move Filter Up button This button moves the highlighted filter up in the list of filters, towards the front of the filtering chain.
Move Filter Down button This button moves the highlighted filter down in the list of filters, towards the end of the filtering chain..
Configure Filter button This button lets you configure the currently highlighted filter. It opens a separate dialog.
Filter Info Pane This field shows some general info about the selected filter. Amongst them are: the filter name (as displayed in the KDEPrint user interface); the filter requirements (that is the external program that needs to be present and executable on this system); the filter input format (in the form of one or several MIME types accepted by the filter); the filter output format (in the form of a MIME type generated by the filter); a more- or less-verbose description of the filter's operation.
Filtering Chain (if enabled, is run before actual job submission to print system.) This field shows which filters are currently selected to act as'pre-filters' for KDEPrint. Pre-filters process the print files before they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem. The list shown in this field may be empty (default). The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a filtering chain where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the'Multipage per Sheet 'filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript. KDEPrint can utilize any external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface. KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work for all print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.. Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are: the Enscript text filter; a Multiple Pages per Sheet filter; a PostScript to PDF converter; a Page Selection/ Ordering filter; a Poster Printing filter; and some more.... To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the funnel icon (top-most on the right icon column group) and proceed. Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters.

Input
Selection of color mode: You can choose between 2 options: Color and Grayscale Note: This selection field may be grayed out and made inactive. This happens if KDEPrint can not retrieve enough information about your print file. In this case the embedded color- or grayscale information of your printfile, and the default handling of the printer take precedence.
Selection of page size: Select the paper size to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed.
Selection of pages per sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting.). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. Note 3, regarding "Other": You cannot really select Other as the number of pages to print on one sheet. "Other" is listed here for information purposes only. To select 8, 9, 16 or other numbers of pages per sheet: go to the tab headlined "Filter"; enable the Multiple Pages per Sheet filter;... and configure it (bottom-most button on the right of the "Filters" tab).
Selection of image orientation: Orientation of the printed page image on your paper is controlled by these radio buttons. By default, the orientation is Portrait. You can select 2 alternatives: Portrait., the default setting; Landscape.. The icon changes according to your selection.

This area contains the status messages for the game. Most of these messages are sent to you from the current engine.
This is the command line. You can type special commands related to the current engine in here. Most relevant commands are also available through the menus.
This is the button bar tool bar. It gives you easy access to game related commands. You can drag the bar to a different location within the window.
This is the status bar. It shows you the currently selected engine in the left corner.

After you finished your moves, they have to be sent to the engine. You can either do that manually (in which case you should not enable this feature), or you can specify an amount of time that has to pass before the move is committed. If you undo a move during the timeout, the timeout will be reset and restarted once you finish the move. This is very useful if you would like to review the result of your move.
Enable timeout
Move timeout in seconds:
Check the box to enable all the messages that you have previously disabled by choosing the "Do not show this message again" option.
Reenable all messages
Check the box to automatically save all window positions on program exit. They will be restored at next start.

You can enable the menubar again with the right mouse button menu of the board.

Set Dice Values
Set the face values of the selected dice. The other player's dice will be cleared and it will be the dice's owner's turn.
This is the bar of the backgammon board. Checkers that have been kicked from the board are put on the bar and remain there until they can be put back on the board. Checkers can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the'short move 'feature. If the cube has not been doubled yet and if it can be used, its face shows 64 and if the cube can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.
This is a regular field of the backgammon board. Checkers can be placed on this field and if the current state of the game and the dice permit this, they can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the'short move 'feature.
This part of the backgammon board is the home. Depending on the direction of the game, one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board. Checkers can never be moved away from the home. If this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this, double clicking on the dice will roll them. Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.

This conduit appears to be broken and cannot be configured.
Conduits are external (possibly third-party) programs that perform synchronization actions. They may have individual configurations. Select a conduit to configure it, and enable it by clicking on its checkbox.
The general portion of KPilot's setup contains settings for your hardware and the way KPilot should display your data. For the basic setup, which should fulfill the need of most users, just use the setup wizard below. If you need some special settings, this dialog provides all the options for fine-tuning KPilot. But be warned: The HotSync settings are various esoteric things. You can enable an action or conduit by clicking on its checkbox. Checked conduits will be run during a HotSync. Select a conduit to configure it.

John Doe
Neither KPilot nor the handheld have a username set. They should be set. Should KPilot set them to a default value (%1)?
User Unknown
The handheld has a username set (%1) but KPilot does not. Should KPilot use this username in future?
KPilot has a username set (%1) but the handheld does not. Should KPilot's username be set in the handheld as well?
(Note: If your handheld has been reset to factory defaults, you should use Restore instead of a regular HotSync. Click on Cancel to stop this sync.)
The handheld thinks that the username is %1; however, KPilot says you are %2. Which of these is the correct name? If you click on Cancel, the sync will proceed, but the usernames will not be changed.

Regular Expression Editor What you are currently looking at is an editor for Regular Expressions. The upper part in the middle is the editing area, the lower part is a verification window where you can try your regular expressions right away. The row of buttons is the editing actions. This is actually very similar to common drawing programs. Select an editing tool to start editing your regular expression, and press the mouse button in the editing area where you want this item inserted. For a more detailed description of this editor see the info pages What is a regular expression? If you do not know what a regular expression is, then it might be a good idea to read the introduction to regular expressions.
Send the author an electronic postcard I do n't get any money for working on KRegExpEditor, I therefore appreciate it very much when users tell me what they think about my work. I would therefore be very happy if you sent me a short mail, telling me that you use my regular expression editor. Author Jesper K. Pedersen & lt; blackie@kde. org gt;
Regular Expression Editor
Compound regular expression:
In this window you will find predefined regular expressions. Both regular expressions you have developed and saved, and regular expressions shipped with the system.
In this window you will develop your regular expressions. Select one of the actions from the action buttons above, and click the mouse in this window to insert the given action.
Type in some text in this window, and see what the regular expression you have developed matches. Each second match will be colored in red and each other match will be colored blue, simply so you can distinguish them from each other. If you select part of the regular expression in the editor window, then this part will be highlighted - This allows you to debug your regular expressions
ASCII syntax:
Clear expression
This is the regular expression in ASCII syntax. You are likely only to be interested in this if you are a programmer, and need to develop a regular expression using QRegExp. You may develop your regular expression both by using the graphical editor, and by typing the regular expression in this line edit.

This regular expression matches anything.
spaces
Matches an arbitrary amount of whitespace.
Your names
Your emails
Selection tool
This will change the state of the editor to selection state. In this state you will not be inserting regexp items, but instead select them. To select a number of items, press down the left mouse button and drag it over the items. When you have selected a number of items, you may use cut/ copy/ paste. These functions are found in the right mouse button menu.
Text
This will insert a text field, where you may write text. The text you write will be matched literally. (i. e. you do not need to escape any characters)
A single character specified in a range
This will match a single character from a predefined range. When you insert this widget a dialog box will appear, which lets you specify which characters this regexp item will match.
Any character
This will match any single character
Repeated content
This regexp item will repeat the regexp items it surrounds a specified number of times. The number of times to repeat may be specified using ranges; e. g. it could be specified that it should match from 2 to 4 times, that it should match exactly 5 times, or that it should match at least one time. Examples: If you specify that it should match any time, and the content it surrounds is abc, then this regexp item will match the empty string, the string abc, the string abcabc, the string abcabcabcabc, etc.
This regexp item will match any of its alternatives. Alternatives are specified by placing regexp items on top of each other inside this widget.
Compound regexp
This regexp item serves two purposes: It makes it possible for you to collapse a huge regexp item into a small box. This makes it easier for you to get an overview of large regexp items. This is especially useful if you load a predefined regexp item that you perhaps do not care about the inner workings of.
Beginning of line
This will match the beginning of a line.
End of line
This will match the end of a line.
Word boundary
This asserts a word boundary (This part does not actually match any characters)
Non Word boundary
This asserts a non-word boundary (This part does not actually match any characters)
Positive Look Ahead
This asserts a regular expression (This part does not actually match any characters). You can only use this at the end of a regular expression.
Negative Look Ahead
This asserts a regular expression that must not match (This part does not actually match any characters). You can only use this at the end of a regular expression.

Verification Settings

Toggle on-the-fly verification of regular expression
Enabling this option will make the verifier update for each edit. If the verify window contains much text, or if the regular expression is either complex or matches a lot of time, this may be very slow.
Match Greedy
Toggle greedy matching when verifying the regular expression.
When this option is enabled, the regular expression will be evaluated on a so-called greedy way.

Jack Audio Connection Kit
JACK is a low-latency audio server. It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves. JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and its design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.
