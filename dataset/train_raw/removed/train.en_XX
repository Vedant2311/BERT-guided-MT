Here you can see the currently configured file name schemes which the "Suggest" button in the tag editor uses to extract tag information from a file name. Each string may contain one of the following placeholders: %t: Title %a: Artist %A: Album %T: Track %c: Comment For example, the file name scheme "[%T] %a - %t" would match "[01] Deep Purple - Smoke on the water" but not "(Deep Purple) Smoke on the water". For that second name, you would use the scheme "(%a) %t". Note that the order in which the schemes appear in the list is relevant, since the tag guesser will go through the list from the top to the bottom, and use the first matching scheme.

You have chosen to open another desktop session instead of resuming the current one. The current session will be hidden and a new login screen will be displayed. An F-key is assigned to each session; F%1 is usually assigned to the first session, F%2 to the second session and so on. You can switch between sessions by pressing Ctrl, Alt and the appropriate F-key at the same time. Additionally, the KDE Panel and Desktop menus have actions for switching between sessions.

Comma-separated list of tags that define this DTEP. The format used is tagname(attribute[defaultvalue]). If the parent (a real) DTEP has a tag with tagname and the attribute value of this tag is equal with the name of this DTEP, the tag area is parsed according to the rules of this DTEP. If [defaultvalue] is present, it means that if the attribute is not present in the tag it is taken as present with value = defaultvalue. Example: Tags=style(type[text/ css]) means that both lt; stylegt; and lt; stylenbsp; type="text/ css"gt; are treated the same way and the DTEP defined by this tag is named text/ css.

For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Setting this option to false can lead to buggy behavior, so users are strongly discouraged from changing it from the default of true. Many actions (e.g. clicking in the client area, moving or resizing the window) normally raise the window as a side-effect. Setting this option to false, which is strongly discouraged, will decouple raising from other user actions, and ignore raise requests generated by applications. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445447#c6. Even when this option is false, windows can still be raised by an alt-left-click anywhere on the window, a normal click on the window decorations, or by special messages from pagers, such as activation requests from tasklist applets. This option is currently disabled in click-to-focus mode. Note that the list of ways to raise windows when raise_on_click is false does not include programmatic requests from applications to raise windows; such requests will be ignored regardless of the reason for the request. If you are an application developer and have a user complaining that your application does not work with this setting disabled, tell them it is _their_ fault for breaking their window manager and that they need to change this option back to true or live with the "bug" they requested.

Print Text with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) ASCII file printouts can be'prettyfied 'by enabling this option. If you do so, a header is printed at the top of each page. The header contains the page number, job title (usually the filename), and the date. In addition, C and C++ keywords are highlighted, and comment lines are italicized. This prettyprint option is handled by CUPS. If you prefer another'plaintext-to-prettyprint' converter, look for the enscript pre-filter on the Filters tab.

In order to activate the login screen, you must first add users in the administration part of GCompris. You access Administration by running 'gcompris -a'. In Administration, you can create different profiles. In each profile, you can have a different set of users and select which activities are available to them. To run GCompris for a specific profile, you use 'gcompris -p profile' where 'profile' is the name of a profile as you created it in Administration.

Right Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the right margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-right=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.

Detect recursive cycles If this is switched off, the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see documentation). The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; therefore, there is the option to switch this off.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

You may need to correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good results. The test images help you to find proper settings. You can save them system-wide to XF86Config (root access is required for that) or to your own KDE settings. On multi head systems you can correct the gamma values separately for all screens.

If checked, the sky will remain focused on its current position or object as time passes. This is called "Tracking". Note that tracking is automatically engaged whenever an object is centered at the focus point. So, if you use "lookToward" with an object name, you do not need to engage tracking. If unchecked, then Tracking will be forced off, even if an object has been centered. As time passes, the sky will then appear to drift by (due to the rotation of the Earth).

The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.

KDE is available free of charge, but costs are incurred and assets formed in its creation. Thus, the KDE community formed KDE e.V., a non-profit organization legally founded in Tuebingen, Germany. KDE e.V. represents the KDE community in legal and financial matters. See http://www.kde-ev.orgfor information on KDE e.V. KDE benefits from financial support. Most of the funds raised are used to reimburse members and others for expenses they incur when contributing to KDE. You are encouraged to support KDE through a financial donation, using one of the ways described at http://www.kde.org/support/. Thank you very much in advance for your support.

Force Dump This forces a dump for a Callgrind profile run in the current directory. This action is checked while KCachegrind looks for the dump. If the dump is finished, it automatically reloads the current trace. If this is the one from the running Callgrind, the new created trace part will be loaded, too. Force dump creates a file'callgrind. cmd ', and checks every second for its existence. A running Callgrind will detect this file, dump a trace part, and delete'callgrind. cmd'. The deletion is detected by KCachegrind, and it does a Reload. If there is no Callgrind running, press'Force Dump 'again to cancel the dump request. This deletes'callgrind. cmd' itself and stops polling for a new dump. Note: A Callgrind run only detects existence of'callgrind. cmd 'when actively running a few milliseconds, i. e. not sleeping. Tip: For a profiled GUI program, you can awake Callgrind e. g. by resizing a window of the program.
You need a user account on the KDE bug tracking system in order to file a bug report, because we may need to contact you later for requesting further information. If you do not have one, you can freely create one here.

- In the 'Boards' section you can change the list of activities. Just untoggle them in the treeview. You can change the language used for reading, for example, then the language used for saying the names of colors. - You can save multiple configurations, and switch between them easily. In the 'Profile' section add a profile, then in the 'Board' section select the profile in the combobox, then select the boards you want to be active. You can add multiple profiles, with different lists of boards, and different languages. You set the default profile in the 'Profile' section, by choosing the profile you want, then clicking on the 'Default' button. You can also choose a profile from the command line. - You can add users, classes and for each class, you can create groups of users. Note that you can import users from a comma-separated file. Assign one or more groups to a profile, after which those new logins will appear after restarting GCompris. Being able to identify individual children in GCompris means we can provide individual reports. It also recognizes the children as individuals; they can learn to type in and recognize their own usernames (login is configurable).

Could not get information for file '%s': %s
No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.

Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.

Top Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the top margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Date2
Pages per Sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. However, some printers are independently capable of printing multiple pages per sheet. In which case you find the option in the printer driver settings. Be careful: if you enable multiple pages per sheet in both places, your printout will not look as you intended. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o number-up=... # examples: "2" or "4"

The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "lt;Ctlgt;" and "lt;Ctrlgt;". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

Then you have to rechoose the same letter, to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter. For example, the word to guess is "potato". If this option is unchecked, when you try "o", the two instances of "o" in the word will be discovered at the same time. If this is checked, you will need to try "o" twice. Default is that for one letter typed, all instances of that letter in the word are discovered.

Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Penrose_tiling Written by Timo Korvola; 1997.

Select your constrained aspect ratio for cropping. Aspect Ratio Crop tool uses a relative ratio. That means it is the same if you use centimeters or inches and it does not specify the physical size. You can see below a correspondence list of traditional photographic paper sizes and aspect ratio crop: 2:3: 10x15cm, 20x30cm, 30x45cm, 4x6 ", 8x12", 12x18 ", 16x24", 20x30 "3:4: 6x8cm, 15x20cm, 18x24cm, 30x40cm, 3.75x5", 4.5x6 ", 6x8", 7.5x10 ", 9x12" 4:5: 20x25cm, 40x50cm, 8x10 ", 16x20" 5:7: 15x21cm, 30x42cm, 5x7 "7:10: 21x30cm, 42x60cm, 3.5x5" The Golden Ratio is 1:1.618. A composition following this rule is considered visually harmonious but can be unadapted to print on standard photographic paper.

Bottom Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the bottom margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-bottom=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other. The attraction/ repulsion is proportional to the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak nuclear forces. Written by Jamie Zawinski and John Pezaris; 1992.

The server does not seem to support pipelining; therefore, this option has been disabled. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on. But please note that this feature can cause some POP servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupt messages. So before using this feature with important mail you should first test it by sending yourself a larger number of test messages which you all download in one go from the POP server.

Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes.

Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

Margins These settings control the margins of printouts on the paper. They are not valid for jobs originating from applications that define their own page layout internally and send PostScript to KDEPrint (such as KOffice or OpenOffice. org). When printing from KDE applications, such as KMail and Konqueror, or printing an ASCII text file through kprinter, you can choose your preferred margin settings here. Margins may be set individually for each edge of the paper. The combo box at the bottom lets you change the units of measurement between Pixels, Millimeters, Centimeters, and Inches. You can even use the mouse to grab one margin and drag it to the intended position (see the preview picture on the right side). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # example: "72" -o page-bottom=... # example: "24" -o page-left=... # example: "36" -o page-right=... # example: "12"

Name / Address field Here you can enter the host name or address. The host may be specified in a number of ways: single host This is the most common format. You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).

At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owaregt;)

During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

Shred source file: Checking this option will shred (overwrite several times before erasing) the files you have encrypted. This way, it is almost impossible that the source file is recovered. But you must be aware that this is not absolutely secure on all file systems, and that parts of the file may have been saved in a temporary file or in the spooler of your printer if you previously opened it in an editor or tried to print it. Only works on files (not on folders).

Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses) Whether or not to use implicit classes. Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both. When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e. g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue. Enabled by default.
Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".

You can click on the desktop name to switch to that desktop, or on a window name to shift focus to that window, switching desktops if necessary, and restoring the window if it is hidden. Hidden or minimized windows are represented with their names in parentheses. Desktop menu: a context menu for the desktop pops up. Among other things, this menu has options for configuring the display, locking the screen, and logging out of KDE. Application menu: the "K" menu pops up. This might be useful for quickly accessing applications if you like to keep the panel (also known as "Kicker") hidden from view.

Turn Text Printing with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) On. ASCII text file printouts can be'prettyfied 'by enabling this option. If you do so, a header is printed at the top of each page. The header contains the page number, job title (usually the filename), and the date. In addition, C and C++ keywords are highlighted, and comment lines are italicized. This prettyprint option is handled by CUPS. If you prefer another'plaintext-to-prettyprint' converter, look for the enscript pre-filter on the Filters tab. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o prettyprint=true.

Key Server: A Key Server is a centralized repository of PGP/ GnuPG keys connected to the Internet which can be conveniently accessed in order to obtain or deposit keys. Select from the drop down list to specify which key server should be used. Often these keys are held by people whom the user has never met and as such the authenticity is dubious at best. Refer to the GnuPG manual covering "Web-of-Trust" relationships to find out how GnuPG works around the problem of verifying authenticity.

Here you can edit the Samba users, stored in the smbpasswd file. Every Samba user must have a corresponding UNIX user. On the right you can see all UNIX users, stored in the passwd file and not configured as Samba users. You can see the Samba users on the left-hand side. To add new Samba users simply press the lt; add button. The selected UNIX users will then become Samba users and will be removed from the UNIX users list (but they will remain UNIX users). To remove Samba users click the gt; remove button. The selected Samba users will be removed from the smbpasswd file and reappear on the right-hand side, as UNIX users which are not Samba users.
This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it is useful, for example, for installing the possibility to boot from a floppy disk without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tangram (Chinese: literally "seven boards of cunning") is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800. It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; taking the square as the unit: \t* 5 right isosceles triangles \t\to 2 small (legs of 1) \t\to 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2) \t\to 2 large size (legs of 2) \t* 1 square (side of 1) \t* 1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)

Paper Size This field indicates the paper size the poster tiles will be printed on. To select a different paper size for your poster tiles, go to the'General 'tab of this dialog and select one from the drop-down list. Available sizes are most standard paper sizes supported by your printer. Your printer's supported paper sizes are read from the printer driver info (as laid down in the'PPD', the printer description file.) Be aware that the'Paper Size 'selected may not be supported by'poster' (example: 'HalfLetter ') while it may well be supported by your printer. If you hit that obstacle, simply use another, supported Paper Size, such as'A4' or'Letter '. Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of paper size. It indicates how many tiles need to be printed to make up the poster, given the selected paper and poster size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click' on the tiles ('shift-click 'means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and for the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed):' Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.

The global keybinding for showing the Tomboy applet's menu. The format looks like "lt;Controlgt;a" or "lt;Shiftgt;lt;Altgt;F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "lt;Ctlgt;" and "lt;Ctrlgt;". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

Choose the storage format of the groupware folders. The default format is to use the ical (for calendar folders) and vcard (for address book folders) standards. This format makes all Kontact features available. The Kolab XML format uses a custom model that matches more closely the one used in Outlook. This format gives better Outlook compatibility, when using a Kolab server or a compatible solution.

HP-GL Print Options All options on this page are only applicable if you use KDEPrint to send HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 files to one of your printers. HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 are page description languages developed by Hewlett-Packard to drive Pen Plotting devices. KDEPrint can (with the help of CUPS) convert the HP-GL file format and print it on any installed printer. Note 1: To print HP-GL files, start'kprinter 'and simply load the file into the running kprinter. Note 2: The'fitplot' parameter provided on this dialog also works for printing PDF files (if your CUPS version is more recent than 1.1.22.) Additional hint for power users: These KDEPrint GUI elements correspond to the CUPS command line job option parameters: -o blackplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o fitplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o penwidth=... # examples: "true" or "false"

Jobs:
Job Priority Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: First In, First Out. The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs. It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your own jobs.) Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-priority=... # example: "10" or "66" or "99"

No wdelay This option only has effect if sync is also set. The NFS server will normally delay committing a write request to disk slightly if it suspects that another related write request may be in progress or may arrive soon. This allows multiple write requests to be committed to disk with the one operation which can improve performance. If an NFS server received mainly small unrelated requests, this behavior could actually reduce performance, so no wdelay is available to turn it off.

Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.

The last item in the list will show you the number of skipped functions, together with a cost condition for these skipped functions. To activate a function with small costs, search for it and select it in the flat profile. Selecting functions with small cost will temporarily add them to the flat profile list.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the %1 text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the %2 text area when you click Save, %3 will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

'Use any current or future standard CUPS job option 'is not supported by the KDEPrint GUI. Control any custom job option you may want to support using custom CUPS filters and backends plugged into the CUPS filtering chain. Send short messages to the operators of your production printers in your Central Repro Department. Standard CUPS job options: A complete list of standard CUPS job options is in the CUPS User Manual. Mappings of the kprinter user interface widgets to respective CUPS job option names are provided in the various What's This help items. Custom CUPS job options: CUPS print servers may be customized with additional print filters and backends which understand custom job options. You can specify such custom job options here. If in doubt, ask your system administrator. Operator Messages: You may send additional messages to the operator(s) of your production printers (e. g. in your Central Repro Department). Messages can be read by the operator(s) (or yourself) by viewing the "Job IPP Report" for the job. Examples: A standard CUPS job option: (Name) number-up -- (Value) 9 A job option for custom CUPS filters or backends: (Name) DANKA_watermark -- (Value) Company_Confidential A message to the operator(s): (Name) Deliver_after_completion -- (Value) to_Marketing_Departm. Note: the fields must not include spaces, tabs or quotes. You may need to double-click on a field to edit it. Warning: Do not use CUPS options that can also be controlled through the KDEPrint GUI. Results may be unpredictable if the options conflict, or if they are sent multiple times. For all options supported by the GUI, please use the GUI. (Each GUI element's'What's This' names the related CUPS option name.)

Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

A dehydrator is a piece of laboratory apparatus, often made of glass, and which serves to dry chemical matters; that is, to remove water or liquid from a sample. \t\t\tIn principle it is a glass bowl with cap that has a planar grinding, so that the bowl is air-tight. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent such as calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. The sample to be dried is placed on a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramic above the drying agent. \t\t\tThe drying agent is hygroscopic, which means that it dehumidifies its environment by absorbing water vapor. The dry atmosphere then takes up water from the sample to be dried.

The editor-based debconf frontend presents you with one or more text files to edit. This is one such text file. If you are familiar with standard unix configuration files, this file will look familiar to you -- it contains comments interspersed with configuration items. Edit the file, changing any items as necessary, and then save it and exit. At that point, debconf will read the edited file, and use the values you entered to configure the system.

Page Set: Choose "All Pages", "Even Pages" or "Odd Pages" if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms. The default is "All Pages". Note: If you combine a selection of a "Page Range" with a "Page Set" of "Odd" or "Even", you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range. This is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex-only printer. In this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice; in the first pass, select "Odd" or "Even" (depending on your printer model), in second pass select the other option. You may need to "Reverse" the output in one of the passes (depending on your printer model). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-set=... # example: "odd" or "even"

List of Driver Options (from PPD). The upper pane of this dialog page contains all print job options as laid down in the printer's description file (PostScript Printer Description == 'PPD '.) Click on any item in the list and watch the lower pane of this dialog page display the available values. Set the values as needed, then use one of the push buttons below to proceed: 'Save' your settings if you want to re-use them in your next job(s) too. 'Save 'will store your settings permanently until you change them again.. Click'OK' (without a prior click on'Save '), if you want to use your selected settings just once, for the next print job. 'OK' will forget your current settings when kprinter is closed again, and will start next time with the previously saved defaults. 'Cancel 'will not change anything. If you proceed to print after clicking'Cancel', the job will print with the default settings of this queue. Note. The number of available job options depends strongly on the actual driver used for your print queue. 'Raw 'queues do not have a driver or a PPD. For raw queues this tab page is not loaded by KDEPrint, and thus is not present in the kprinter dialog.

The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.

Max jobs per user (MaxJobsPerUser) The MaxJobsPerUser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user. Once a user reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).

The Parts Overview A trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run. The Trace Part Overview dockable shows these, horizontally ordered in execution time; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts. You can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only. The parts are further subdivided: there is a partitioning and an callee split mode: Partitioning: You see the partitioning into groups for a trace part, according to the group type selected. E. g. if ELF object groups are selected, you see colored rectangles for each used ELF object (shared library or executable), sized according to the cost spent therein. Callee: A rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown. This is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees.

The number of times to repeat may be specified using ranges; e. g. it could be specified that it should match from 2 to 4 times, that it should match exactly 5 times, or that it should match at least one time. Examples: If you specify that it should match any time, and the content it surrounds is abc, then this regexp item will match the empty string, the string abc, the string abcabc, the string abcabcabcabc, etc.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.

The format looks like "<Control>a" or "<Shift><Alt>F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "<Ctl>" and "<Ctrl>". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action. This keybinding may be reversed by holding down the "shift" key; therefore, "shift" cannot be one of the keys it uses.

This is an exercise in moving around. Follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right. The hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths (like _ _BAR_ L or U), so be careful not to get too far ahead of him. DANGER: Try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right. If you do get trapped there, the only way out is to kill the hero (press key Q for quit) and start the level again.

Speed tradeoff for when to show a file as a thumbnail. If set to "always" then always thumbnail, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show thumbnails for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to thumbnail files, just use a generic icon. Despite what the name may suggest, this applies to any previewable file type.

Usage: apt-ftparchive [options] command Commands: packages binarypath [overridefile [pathprefix]] sources srcpath [overridefile [pathprefix]] contents path release path generate config [groups] clean config apt-ftparchive generates index files for Debian archives. It supports many styles of generation from fully automated to functional replacements for dpkg-scanpackages and dpkg-scansources apt-ftparchive generates Package files from a tree of .debs. The Package file contains the contents of all the control fields from each package as well as the MD5 hash and filesize. An override file is supported to force the value of Priority and Section. Similarly apt-ftparchive generates Sources files from a tree of .dscs. The --source-override option can be used to specify a src override file The 'packages' and 'sources' command should be run in the root of the tree. BinaryPath should point to the base of the recursive search and override file should contain the override flags. Pathprefix is appended to the filename fields if present. Example usage from the Debian archive: apt-ftparchive packages dists/potato/main/binary-i386/ > \\ dists/potato/main/binary-i386/Packages Options: -h This help text --md5 Control MD5 generation -s=? Source override file -q Quiet -d=? Select the optional caching database --no-delink Enable delinking debug mode --contents Control contents file generation -c=? Read this configuration file -o=?

Saturation: Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used. The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image, similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers, a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers, a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o saturation=... # use range from "0" to "200"

Use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service. Note that if the port is already in use the Desktop Sharing service will not be accessible until you free it. It is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing. Most VNC clients use a display number instead of the actual port. This display number is the offset to port 5900, so port 5901 has the display number 1.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.

Cut Margin selection This slider and spinbox let you determine a'cut margin 'to be printed onto each tile of your poster, to help you cut the pieces as needed. Notice, how the little preview window above changes with your change of cut margins. It indicates to you how much space the cut margins will take away from each tile. Be aware, that your cut margins need to be equal to or greater than the margins your printer uses. The printer's capabilities are described in the'ImageableArea' keywords of its driver PPD file.

Listen to (Port/ Listen) Ports/ addresses that are listened to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what is used here. You can have multiple Port/ Listen lines to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access. Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...). ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631

You can choose what happens when you click on the desktop using your pointing device's middle button: No action Window list menu: a menu showing all windows on all virtual desktops pops up. You can click on the desktop name to switch to that desktop, or on a window name to shift focus to that window, switching desktops if necessary, and restoring the window if it is hidden. Hidden or minimized windows are represented with their names in parentheses. Desktop menu: a context menu for the desktop pops up. Among other things, this menu has options for configuring the display, locking the screen, and logging out of KDE. Application menu: the "K" menu pops up. This might be useful for quickly accessing applications if you like to keep the panel hidden from view.

The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.

Check this box if you want to use the linear mode. Linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector/ head/ cylinder. Linear mode is required for some SCSI drives, and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer. See the lilo. conf man page for details.

In case you do not know the encoding of your files, select utf8 and enable the creation of backup files. This setting will autodetect utf8 and utf16 files, but the changed files will be converted to utf8.

A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM at which point a contact sensor is activated. In this way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.

KMail import filter Select the base directory of the KMail mailfolder you want to import. Note: Never select your current local KMail maildir (usually ~/ Mail or ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kmail/ mail): in this case, KMailCVT may become stuck in a continuous loop. This filter does not import KMail mailfolders with mbox files. Since it is possible to recreate the folder structure, the folders will be stored under: "KMail-Import" in your local folder.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Bracketing to HDR
Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination media, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...). Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

You do not know anything about encryption? No problem, simply create yourself a key pair in the key management window. Then, export your public key and mail it to your friends. Ask them to do the same and import their public keys. Finally, to send an encrypted message, type it in the KGpg editor, then click & quot; encryptquot;. Choose your friend key and click & quot; encryptquot; again. The message will be encrypted, ready to be sent by email.

Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.

Trap the first enemy immediately. Go up and right and hang on the ladder to the right of a short bar. As the enemy arrives, climb up quickly. As he reaches you again, go left, drop and go up the left hand ladder to the top. The enemy should head right, over the concrete, and fall. Now go down to the bottom left corner. The enemy should drop into a false brick next to the gold. Collect all gold at the top, then dig and drop to the next enemy. Stand on him, dig left and move right. The enemy will drop into the pit. Move to the right and collect more gold as you fall. Climb to the top, drop onto the trapped enemy via a false brick under a bar and collect five more nuggets. Now dig and go down the short ladder at the right of the bricks, to kill the enemy in the pit (who has more gold). He should reappear above you and fall through a false brick back into the pit. Dig three bricks between the two enemies and go down the short ladder until the enemies bunch up. Dig two more bricks to release them. Go up the ladder, over the concrete and, just before the enemies get up to the concrete, drop down to the floor and run to the bottom of the short ladder. The enemies should come down and run into the double pit on the right. Quickly run out to the right, over the enemies. Drop onto the last piece of gold, over on the right and the hidden ladders appear. Phew! P. S. Another way to trap the left hand enemy in the false brick is to get him to follow you up the leftmost ladder while you run across the top and dig to drop onto the second enemy. Timing is VERY tight. You must dig and drop before the enemy climbs over the top left and runs right. Later, climb the right hand ladders to the top, wait on the left hand bar over a false brick till the leftmost enemy starts to run towards you, then drop. Wait again till he starts to drop, then dig two bricks at the right of a short ladder, go right and drop, then run left to the bottom of a short ladder. The enemy should drop through a false brick and a ladder into the false brick beneath. P. P. S. There is no room for error or hesitation in this method! Not much in the first method either!

Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-hold-until=... # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"

Selection of pages per sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting.). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. Note 3, regarding "Other": You cannot really select Other as the number of pages to print on one sheet. "Other" is listed here for information purposes only. To select 8, 9, 16 or other numbers of pages per sheet: go to the tab headlined "Filter"; enable the Multiple Pages per Sheet filter;... and configure it (bottom-most button on the right of the "Filters" tab).

Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.

If you want to set the folder names of the IMAP storage to your local language, you can choose between these available languages. Please note, that the only reason to do so is for compatibility with Microsoft Outlook. It is considered a bad idea to set this, since it makes changing languages impossible.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or any other KDE application using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer from a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

The Black Point Compensation (BPC) feature works in conjunction with Relative Colorimetric Intent. With Perceptual Intent, it should make no difference, since BPC is always on, and with Absolute Colorimetric, Intent it is always turned off. BPC compensates for a lack of ICC profiles for rendering dark tones. With BPC the dark tones are optimally mapped (no clipping) from original the medium to the destination rendering medium, e. g. the combination of paper and ink.

Profile Dumps This dockable shows in the top part the list of loadable profile dumps in all subdirectories of: current working directory of KCachegrind, i. e. where it was started from, and the default profile dump directory given in the configuration. The list is sorted according to the target command profiled in the corresponding dump. On selecting a profile dump, information for it is shown in the bottom area of the dockable: Options allows you to view the profiled command and profile options of this dump. By changing any item, a new (yet unexisting) profile template is created. Press Run Profile to start a profile run with these options in the background. Info gives detailed info on the selected dump like event cost summary and properties of the simulated cache. State is only available for current happening profiles runs. Press Update to see different counters of the run, and a stack trace of the current position in the program profiled. Check the Every option to let KCachegrind regularly poll these data. Check the Sync option to let the dockable activate the top function in the current loaded dump.

Select a drawing tool on the left, and a color down the bottom. Then click and drag in the white area to create a new shape. Once you've completed a drawing, you can select a new frame to work on by selecting one of the small rectangles on the bottom. Each frame contains the same content as its previous one. You can then edit it by moving objects a little bit or adding/deleting objects. When you create several frames and then click on the 'film' button, you will see all your images in a continuous slide-show (an infinite loop pattern). You can change the last image in your film by right clicking on a time frame. You can also change the viewing speed in this mode. In viewing mode, click on the 'drawing' button to return to drawing mode. You can also save and reload your animations with the 'floppy disk' and 'folder' buttons.

Troubleshooting the IMAP Cache If you have problems with synchronizing an IMAP folder, you should first try rebuilding the index file. This will take some time to rebuild, but will not cause any problems. If that is not enough, you can try refreshing the IMAP cache. If you do this, you will lose all your local changes for this folder and all its subfolders.

Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.

Here you can choose to Simple Search directly or to use some keywords to specify some attributes, such as the artist name and so on. The keywords selectable are divided by their specific value. Some keywords are numeric and others are alphanumeric. You do not need to know it directly. When a keyword is numeric it will be used to search the numeric data for each track. The alphanumeric keywords are the following: album, artist, filename (including path), mountpoint (e. g. / home/ user1), filetype (you can specify mp3, ogg, flac,... and the file extensions will be matched), genre, comment, composer, directory, lyrics, title, and label. The numeric keywords are: bitrate, disc/ discnumber, length (expressed in seconds), playcount, rating, samplerate, score, size/ filesize (expressed in bytes, kbytes, and megabytes as specified in the unit for the filesize keyword), track (i. e. the track number), and year.

Conversely if you suspect an error in Konqueror, please file a bug report at http: / /bugs. kde. org/. A test case which illustrates the problem will be appreciated.

Duplex Printing: These controls may be grayed out if your printer does not support duplex printing (i. e. printing on both sides of the sheet.) These controls are active if your printer supports duplex printing. You can choose from 3 alternatives: None. This prints each page of the job on one side of the sheets only. Long Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job in a way so that the backside has the same orientation as the front side if you fold the paper over the long edge. (Some printer drivers call this mode duplex-non-tumbled.) Short Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job so that the backside has the reverse orientation from the front side if you turn the paper over the long edge, but the same orientation, if you turn it over the short edge. (Some printer drivers name this mode duplex-tumbled.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o duplex=... # examples: "tumble" or "two-sided-short-edge"

The image data you are trying to paste has no color profile information. On the web and in simple applications the data are supposed to be in sRGB color format. Importing as web will show it as it is supposed to look. Most monitors are not perfect though so if you made the image yourself you might want to import it as it looked on you monitor. How do you want to interpret these data?

If this is enabled, then the remote FTP server will open up a port for the data connection. If you are behind a firewall, you will need to enable this. Generally, it is a good idea to keep this enabled unless you are connecting to an older FTP server that doesn't support this. If this is disabled, then gFTP will open up a port on the client side and the remote server will attempt to connect to it.

UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. During the requested copy operation, KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.

Filtering Chain (if enabled, is run before actual job submission to print system.) This field shows which filters are currently selected to act as'pre-filters' for KDEPrint. Pre-filters process the print files before they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem. The list shown in this field may be empty (default). The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a filtering chain where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the'Multipage per Sheet 'filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript. KDEPrint can utilize any external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface. KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work for all print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.. Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are: the Enscript text filter; a Multiple Pages per Sheet filter; a PostScript to PDF converter; a Page Selection/ Ordering filter; a Poster Printing filter; and some more.... To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the funnel icon (top-most on the right icon column group) and proceed. Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters.

If this option is selected, the Tab key either indents the current line or advances to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space character in the line, or if there is a selection, the current line is indented by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no selection, white space is inserted so that the next tab postion is reached: if the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.

Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination device, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,....) Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.

Normally, if a server exports two filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is mounted. That filesystem is "hidden". Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not to be hidden, and an appropriately authorized client will be able to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing the change. However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode number. The nohide option is currently only effective on single host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports. This option can be very useful in some situations, but it should be used with due care, and only after confirming that the client system copes with the situation effectively.

This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

Insecure locks This option tells the NFS server not to require authentication of locking requests (i. e. requests which use the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be performed. Early NFS client implementations did not send credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are world readable.

Entering a LDAP server here will make all LDAP requests go to that server first. More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.
Couldn't retrieve data from key server
If this is enabled, then the remote FTP server's PASV IP address field will be ignored and the host's IP address will be used instead. This is often needed for routers giving their internal rather then their external IP address in a PASV reply.

Set Pen Width for HP-GL (if not defined in file). The pen width value can be set here in case the original HP-GL file does not have it set. The pen width specifies the value in micrometers. The default value of 1000 produces lines that are 1000 micrometers == 1 millimeter in width. Specifying a pen width of 0 produces lines that are exactly 1 pixel wide. Note: The pen width option set here is ignored if the pen widths are set inside the plot file itself. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o penwidth=... # example: "2000" or "500"

Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.

Scale Print Image to Page Size The'fitplot 'option specifies that the HP-GL image should be scaled to fill exactly the page with the (elsewhere selected) media size. The default is'fitplot is disabled'. The default will therefore use the absolute distances specified in the plot file. (You should be aware that HP-GL files are very often CAD drawings intended for large format plotters. On standard office printers they will therefore lead to the drawing printout being spread across multiple pages.) Note: This feature depends upon an accurate plot size (PS) command in the HP-GL/ 2 file. If no plot size is given in the file the filter converting the HP-GL to PostScript assumes the plot is ANSI E size. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o fitplot=true

If you are using SCSI emulation (possible if you have an IDE CD writer) then make sure you check that you have read and write permissions on the generic SCSI device, which is probably / dev/ sg0, / dev/ sg1, etc..

When this option is enabled, the passphrase of your private key will be remembered by the application as long as the application is running. Thus you will only have to enter the passphrase once. Be aware that this could be a security risk. If you leave your computer, others can use it to send signed messages and/ or read your encrypted messages. If a core dump occurs, the contents of your RAM will be saved onto disk, including your passphrase. Note that when using KMail, this setting only applies if you are not using gpg-agent. It is also ignored if you are using crypto plugins.

The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.

Regular expression to find the type of the element. The pattern is searched on the result of the DefinitionRx match and the first captured area will hold the element type. Example (simplified): DefinitionRx=\\$+([a-zA-Z]+)=new\\\\s[a-zA-Z]+; TypeRx=new\\\\s([a-zA-Z]+); This will match strings like $fooObj=new foo;. Now this string is searched and it will find new foo;, where foo is the first captured text (the regular expression matching foo is between brackets). So the type of $fooObj is foo.

Evolution 2. x import filter Select the base directory of your local Evolution mailfolder (usually ~/. evolution/ mail/ local/). Note: Never choose a Folder which does not contain mbox-files (for example a maildir): if you do, you will get many new folders. Since it is possible to recreate the folder structure, the folders will be stored under: "Evolution-Import".
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.

Setup proxy configuration. A proxy server is an intermediate machine that sits between your computer and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to web sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching those pages; filtering proxy servers usually provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. If you are uncertain whether or not you need to use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, consult your Internet service provider's setup guide or your system administrator.

Printer Selection Menu: Use this combo box to select the printer to which you want to print. Initially (if you run KDEPrint for the first time), you may only find the KDE special printers (which save jobs to disk [as PostScript- or PDF-files], or deliver jobs via email (as a PDF attachment). If you are missing a real printer, you need to...... either create a local printer with the help of the KDE Add Printer Wizard. The Wizard is available for the CUPS and RLPR printing systems (click button to the left of the'Properties' button),... or try to connect to an existing remote CUPS print server. You can connect by clicking the'System Options' button below. A new dialog opens: click on the'CUPS server 'icon: Fill in the information required to use the remote server. Note: It may happen that you successfully connected to a remote CUPS server and still do not get a printer list. If this happens: force KDEPrint to re-load its configuration files. To reload the configuration files, either start kprinter again, or switch the print system away from CUPS and back again once. The print system switch can be made through a selection in the drop-down menu at bottom of this dialog when fully expanded).

This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.

The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. There is a legend about a Hindu temple whose priests were constantly engaged in moving a set of 64 discs according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. According to the legend, the world would end when the priests finished their work. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle. It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was inspired by it. (source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_hanoigt;)

Left Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the left margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-left=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.

The lower pane of this dialog page contains all possible values of the print option highlighted above, as laid down in the printer's description file (PostScript Printer Description == 'PPD '.) Select the value you want and proceed. Then, use one of the push buttons below to leave this dialog: 'Save' your settings if you want to re-use them in your next job(s) too. 'Save 'will store your settings permanently until you change them again.. Click'OK' if you want to use your selected settings just once, for the next print job. 'OK 'will forget your current settings when kprinter is closed again, and will start next time with your previous defaults. 'Cancel' will not change anything. If you proceed to print after clicking'Cancel ', the job will print with the default settings of this queue. Note. The number of available job options depends strongly on the actual driver used for your print queue. 'Raw' queues do not have a driver or a PPD. For raw queues this tab page is not loaded by KDEPrint, and thus is not present in the kprinter dialog.

If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory.

This plugin has a video encoder API but writes a series of single raw frames instead of one videofile. the filetype of the output frames is derived from the extension. the extension is the suffix part of the parameter "videofile". the names of the output frame(s) are same as the parameter "videofile" but the framenumber part is replaced by the current framenumber (or added automatic if videofile has no number part) audiodata is ignored.WARNINGS: for proper operation, the handled frames shall refere to single video file without any transitions. this allows fetching frames as raw data chunks. The chunks are 1:1 written to disc as framefiles. The resulting raw data frames on disc may be unusable if the raw chunk data is not compatible to any image fileformat.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

If this is disabled, the selected language does not support it. If this is enabledand if you check it, then you should type accented letters on their own. If it is not checked, accented letters will be displayed with normal letters (default). For example, in Catalan, if this is unchecked and you type "o", the o and ò will be displayed in the word xenofòbia. If this option is checked, when you type "o", only "o" will be displayed and you will have to type "ò" for this letter to be displayed.

An Erlenmeyer flask, named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), is different to a beaker in that it comes with an inverted conical base and a cylindrical neck. There are different types of Erlenmeyer flasks for laboratory applications: the narrow neck and wide neck forms. Depending on the application the flask may have precision grinding to allow good connection to other containers. \t\t\t \t\t\tThe narrow neck reduces the risk of fluid escaping, especially when boiling or during reactions which agitate the contents. \t\t\t \t\t\tAn Erlenmeyer flask is useful for mixing fluids or accelerating reactions by stirring or shaking, for example. The Erlenmeyer flask is particularly suited for a magnetic stirrer, since it can be placed directly on the stirring platform. A round-bottomed flask, by contrast, must be placed on a cork ring on the stirring platform.

KDEPrint usually auto-detects the correct print subsystem by itself upon first startup. Most Linux distributions have "CUPS", the Common UNIX Printing System.

List of all Callees This list shows all functions called by the current selected one, either directly or with several function in-between on the stack; the number of function in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the listed function while the selected is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the listed function while the selected one is active. The cost graphic always shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls to the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.

This list shows your configured autobookmark entities. When a document is opened, each entity is used in the following way: The entity is dismissed, if a mime and/ or filename mask is defined, and neither matches the document. Otherwise each line of the document is tried against the pattern, and a bookmark is set on matching lines. Use the buttons below to manage your collection of entities.

Image Size: Drop-down menu to control the image size on the printed paper. The menu works in conjunction with slider below. The options are: Natural Image Size: Image prints in its natural image size. If it does not fit onto one sheet, the printout will be spread across multiple sheets. Note, that the slider is disabled when selecting'natural image size 'in the dropdown menu. Resolution (ppi): The resolution value slider covers a number range from 1 to 1200. It specifies the resolution of the image in Pixels Per Inch (PPI). An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print 10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example, but 5x4 inches at 600 pixels per inch. If the specified resolution makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Resolution defaults to 72 ppi.% of Page Size: The percent value slider covers numbers from 1 to 800. It specifies the size in relation to the page (not the image). A scaling of 100 percent will fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows (doing auto-rotation of the image as needed). A scaling of more than 100 will print the image across multiple sheets. A scaling of 200 percent will print on up to 4 pages. Scaling in% of page size defaults to 100%.% of Natural Image Size: The percent value slider moves from 1 to 800. It specifies the printout size in relation to the natural image size. A scaling of 100 percent will print the image at its natural size, while a scaling of 50 percent will print the image at half its natural size. If the specified scaling makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Scaling in% of natural image size defaults to 100%. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o natural-scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o ppi=... # range in ppi is 1... 1200

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

Enter the URI that is used to perform a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string, whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.

Peter W. composed this in 1985. Do you see the prophetic letters GR? Spooky! When you collect the row of gold at bottom left, wait there and the first enemy will obligingly fall into the pit above you. When you move over to the right side, collect all nuggets except the three hanging under a ladder. Leave them till last. To get the gold above the trapped enemy, climb the ladder, dig down four bricks, wait till they start to re-appear, then dig one more, climb back up, re-dig the first two and the way will be clear to fall in, collect the gold and escape over the enemy's head. When you release the enemy, retreat quickly to where you can trap and kill him. After one or two tries he will re-appear harmlessly over on the left.

In the text entry, enter one command per line, to control your boat. Commands supported are displayed between the two entry areas. The 'left' and 'right' commands must be followed by an angle in degrees. The angle value is also called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degrees is used. The 'forward' command accepts a distance parameter. By default 1 is used. For example: - left 90: Make a perpendicular left turn - forward 10: Go forward for 10 units (as displayed on the ruler). The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line). When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather conditions by using the retry button. You can click and drag your mouse anywhere on the map to get a measurement in distance and angle. Going to the next level will give you more complex weather conditions.

After you enabled &quot;Dynamic Keyboard Shortcutsquot; in the Preferences dialog, you can reassign shortcut keys. Do so by bringing up the menu, selecting a menu item, and pressing the desired key combination. If &quot;Save Keyboard Shortcutsquot; is enabled, the key bindings are saved when you exit GIMP. You should probably disable &quot;Dynamic Keyboard Shortcutsquot; afterwards, to prevent accidentally assigning/reassigning shortcuts.

Choosing a passphrase is an integral part of creating a strong key. Like a password, a passphrase should contain letters, numbers, and punctuation. Additionally, a passphrase can contain spaces, meaning it can contain many words. You should pick a phrase that is easy to rememeber and contains punctuation. Take this phrase, adjust the case of various letters, and change some of the letters into numbers or punctuation, reminiscent of "leet speak", but don't make it so obscure to the point where you can't remember it.

This list should show the types of file that your application can handle. This list is organized by mimetypes. MIME, Multipurpose Internet (e)Mail Extension, is a standard protocol for identifying the type of data based on filename extensions and correspondent mimetypes. Example: the "bmp" part that comes after the dot in flower. bmp indicates that it is a specific kind of image, image/ x-bmp. To know which application should open each type of file, the system should be informed about the abilities of each application to handle these extensions and mimetypes. If you want to associate this application with one or more mimetypes that are not in this list, click on the button Add below. If there are one or more filetypes that this application cannot handle, you may want to remove them from the list clicking on the button Remove below.

SIMTABLE returns one of the values in the given argument list depending on the round number of the simulation tool. When the simulation tool is not activated, SIMTABLE returns @{d1}. With the simulation tool and the SIMTABLE function you can test given decision variables. Each SIMTABLE function contains the possible values of a simulation variable. In most valid simulation models you should have the same number of values @{dN} for all decision variables. If the simulation is run more rounds than there are values defined, SIMTABLE returns #N/A! error (e.g. if A1 contains `=SIMTABLE(1)' and A2 `=SIMTABLE(1,2)', A1 yields #N/A! error on the second round). The successive use of the simulation tool also requires that you give to the tool at least one input variable having RAND() or any other RAND() function in it. On each round, the simulation tool iterates for the given number of rounds over all the input variables to reevaluate them. On each iteration, the values of the output variables are stored, and when the round is completed, descriptive statistical information is created according to the values.

This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.

It looks as though you should trap two enemies in the two pits at the bottom. Try it, but it is very hard to get one into the right hand pit and you are apt to get an enemy with gold in the left hand pit. Four false bricks further left prevent you running over from the left and digging. It is best to pick up the bottom row of gold last, dropping in via the hanging nugget at the right and escaping via the ladder that appears. The key to clearing up the left hand section is the line of ladders embedded in the bricks. Exit via the three places that have false bricks beneath them. It is suicide to drop onto the middle of the T-shaped bricks. Start by collecting the gold on the right of the T: then you can get an enemy to run into the U-shaped pit. Watch out for the false brick in the middle of the platform at the lower left. You have to collect the gold in separate trips from the left and the right.
... that you can get a'Linux console-like 'terminal? Hide Konsole's menubar, tabbar and scrollbar, select the Linux font and the Linux Colors schema and apply the full-screen mode. You might also want to set the KDE panel to auto-hide.
